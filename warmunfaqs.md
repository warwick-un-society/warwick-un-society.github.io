#### When/where is WARMUN XIII?
Warwick University campus, 4pm 22nd to 5pm 24th November.

#### How much is the conference fee?
£15. There is also a social pack available, for which the fee is £30 for conference and ball attendance.
Your place will not be confirmed at the conference until you have paid on our SU website – tickets will be available in the coming days.
#### 
#### What committees will there be?
The conference will have 3 branches - UN Security Council (UNSC), World Bank, and Crisis.

#### Do I register as a single delegate or delegation?
Either - single delegate if applying only for yourself, lead delegate if applying for yourself and others in your university. 

#### Where is the delegate application form?
Applications are open! There is a link to the form on this site and our SU page.

#### When do applications close?
Wednesday 6th November - only 4 weeks! Apply before places fill.

#### Is there a social?
Yes - 2! A drinks social on Friday 22nd and our Yule Ball on Saturday 23rd November. 

#### I’ll need a place to stay at the conference, what do I do?
Ideally you will need to organise your own accommodation. We are offering a sofa-sharing scheme for free with Warwick students, but due to limited availability a space isn’t guaranteed.

#### Is there any special support funding for the conference?
Yes. Provided you inform us in your application form, we will contact you about what is available. You may need to fill in a further support funding form.

#### What food arrangements will we have at the conference?
We will not be providing any food apart from snacks at the social on Friday night and dinner at the Yule Ball on Saturday.
There are however plenty of sites on Warwick campus for affordable food and drink, which you can find on your conference app or in the handbook.

#### How do I know where to go and when?
All information can be found in the conference handbook and delegate app when they are released.

#### When will I receive my cabinet allocation?
We will confirm your attendance as soon as payment is registered. We aim to allocate cabinet positions once applications close after 6th November. 

#### Who can I contact about the conference?
The WARMUN exec email address is [warwickmunsecretariat@gmail.com](mailto:warwickmunsecretariat@gmail.com), which can be contacted in the run-up to the conference and during it.
