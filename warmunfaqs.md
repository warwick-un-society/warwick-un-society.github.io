Yes - 2! A drinks social on Friday 22nd and our Yule Ball on Saturday 23rd November. To attend these you must buy the social pack which is £25.

#### I’ll need a place to stay at the conference, what do I do?
Ideally you will need to organise your own accommodation. We are offering a sofa-sharing scheme for free with Warwick students, but due to limited availability a space isn’t guaranteed.

We will not be providing any food apart from snacks at the social on Friday night and dinner at the Yule Ball on Saturday.
There are however plenty of sites on Warwick campus for affordable food and drink, which you can find on your conference app or in the handbook.

#### How do I know where to go and when?
All information can be found in the conference handbook and delegate app when they are released.

#### When will I receive my cabinet allocation?
We will confirm your attendance as soon as payment is registered. We aim to allocate cabinet positions on Friday 15th November.

#### Who can I contact about the conference?
The WARMUN exec email address is [warwickmunsecretariat@gmail.com](mailto:warwickmunsecretariat@gmail.com), which can be contacted in the run-up to the conference and during it.
