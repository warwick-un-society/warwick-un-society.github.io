As Warwick UN Society, one of our main goals is to ensure that we represent Warwick at various Model United Nations Conferences across the UK and internationally as well. Throughout the year we send delegations to these events, and have always performed exceptionally well. From tailored training for conferences to planning coordinated accommodation we focus on making the experience truly worthwhile. We carefully choose the conferences we go to each year, and hence we have opportunities for all experience levels! 

Upcoming Conferences:
* OxIMUN: 25th to 27th of October
* CUIMUN: 8th to 10th of November
* WARMUN: 22nd to 24th of November
* NottsMUN: 29th of November to 1st of December
