## Researching the Issues

Once you have applied for a conference, you will be allocated a country.  You will normally be part of a team (‘delegation’), with each team member (‘delegate’) representing the country on a different committee.
You will need to start with a team meeting to decide which member of the team (or delegate) will take part in which particular committee.  Each committee will have an agenda and the first stage is to research the issues on the agenda.  The agenda for this conference is printed on page 4.

## Researching your Country

The next stage is to find out about the country the team (or delegation) is representing.  Gather information on the type of government, economy, geography, history, language(s) and culture.  You may find it useful to look up the website of the country’s Embassy or High Commission.

Information can also be found on
[www.theodora.com/wfb/abc_world_fact_book.html](www.theodora.com/wfb/abc_world_fact_book.html) and on [www.un.org](www.un.org), looking in - Member states – Home Pages of Permanent Missions.

Now put the first two stages together and work out your country’s policy on each item on the agenda.

## Policy Statement

Having established what the policy of your country is on an issue, you should then convert this to a policy statement.  Each delegate will need to prepare a policy statement of about 45 seconds on Topic 1 for their committee, which you will need to read out.  It will also be useful to have a policy statement on Topic 2 as well, although you will not need to read this out, because it will help you to decide what to say and which resolutions to support.

A policy statement should contain the following:

* An outline of the particular issue

* A statement of the country’s position on the issue

* Suggestions for a solution to the problem

### Example Policy Statements

Below are some example policy statements, so that you can get an idea of the kind of thing you might want to say.

> Country: **Sweden**
>
> Topic: **Provision of primary education**
>
> Sweden believes strongly in education for all.  Education is essential for citizens to develop the skills needed to be productive in adult life.  Sweden has compulsory education for all children aged 7 to 16.  We believe that this has helped our country to become prosperous.  
>
> Sweden believes that all countries should make the provision of free primary education for all children a priority.  Some countries struggle to provide free education, and Sweden believes that the richer countries in the world should be willing to provide financial support in order to enable this to happen.  Countries with more educated people are more prosperous and able to trade more, so it is in the interests of richer countries to help poorer countries educate their citizens, so that they can trade with them.  Education is also the best way to prevent human rights abuses, to prevent the exploitation of children, and to promote the well-being of women and girls throughout the world.

> Country: **Saudi Arabia**
>
> Topic:  **Exploitation of women**
>
> Saudi Arabia is an Islamic kingdom and follows the teachings of the Qur’an and the principles of Sharia law.  Islam teaches the protection of women by their male relatives, to safeguard them against being exploited.
>
> Saudi Arabia rejects the Western idea that women and men are the same.  It is because we understand that men and women have different roles and obligations in life that we protect our women from having to fend for themselves in a man’s world.  Saudi Arabia condemns the exploitation of women practised in Western countries, which encourage women to excite men’s sexual desires.  Saudi Arabia calls for the honour and dignity of women to be preserved and defended in all countries.

## Dress

Dress for the conference is formal.  Gentlemen should wear suits with collar and tie, and ladies should also be formally dressed.  Delegates who are incorrectly dressed will not be allowed into the General Assembly.

## Headed notepaper

You should bring with you some note-paper with your country name on the top, which you can use to send notes during the conference (see ‘Note-passing’ below).
