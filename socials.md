Warwick United Nations Society is not only one of the best places to debate and expand on the latest developments in global politics, but is also one of the best societies to socialise and interact with students from a huge range of diverse and international backgrounds.

The socials in our society help us to cool off after intense training sessions and roundtable debates and remember that we're (mostly) all friends at the end of the day.

This year, the executive committee aims to bring all our members regular social events which will range from bar crawls to online quizzes and movie nights. These events will all follow the university and government guidelines on socialising to ensure we can have the most fun in the safest way possible.

We cannot wait to meet everyone this year!
