<b>Topics:</b>
  1. Discussion for a relationship 'reset' between Security Council members and their allies with 'rogue states'

International Relations are not only shaped by the interaction between states but also influenced by the intrinsic actions of each state. Although each state has the sovereign power of acting in its chosen manner, wrongful actions attract punishment from the international community, alongside classifications such as “rogue” states. It is important to acknowledge that such classifications shape the interactions between states, create dissent and threaten stability. With this catastrophic implication in mind, it is necessary to move towards actions of peace-building and solidarity, by trying to mediate the conflict between the “rogue” states and the members of the Security Council.

2. Setting new international standards for inter-state weapons trading

At the heart of inter-state weapons trading lies the dilemma of profiteering at the cost of increased risk of harm to others, where the numerous armed conflicts occurring globally cast a dark shadow on the globe. While the Arms Trade Treaty was heralded as an achievement to protect human rights, several countries have ignored it, supplying weapons to other states knowing that they could be used against civilians. It is against this backdrop that the call for new international standards to be set for inter-state weapons trading is made. Delegates will be expected to strike a balance amidst this dilemma.
