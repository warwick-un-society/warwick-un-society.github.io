We are one of the largest and most diverse academic societies on campus that cares deeply about the values of the United Nations. Our goal is to raise awareness on issues of paramount importance and help spread the UN message throughout the campus and beyond. We aim to achieve this both by providing Warwick students the opportunity of participating in negotiation simulations as well as through a series of academic events.

Our society attends a variety of conferences around the UK and beyond, such as OxiMUN, LiMUN, ReadiMUN, KentMUN and WorldMUN. In these conferences, our students are asked to take the role of a UN country representative and debate within the context of a UN committee with the aim of reaching effective solutions on issues of pivotal importance. As a society, we are proud to say that we are one of the most prestigious MUN teams in the UK. We achieve this through holding weekly training sessions as well as conference-specific training sessions. During these hours, students bring their public speaking and negotiation skills to the test; whether it be through normal MUN debate or through one of our special crisis sessions.

As a society we also host our own conference, WARMUN, normally in late November / early December. In previous years this has taken a variety of forms including but not limited to a hybrid GA and crisis conference, and the largest joint cabinet crisis in Europe. Due to the ongoing situation, we will be delaying this event until the second term of this year. More information will be found on official society social media and this website in the coming months.

Apart from our MUN ventures, we also host a diversity of academic events on campus. These include talks from speakers such as Matt Jackson, Director of UNFPA as well as interactive events such as our round-table discussion with Amnesty at Warwick. Our latest round-table discussion was on the effectiveness of the UNHRC. We have also held an International Court of Justice simulation, joined by students from all around the UK. We were more than proud to see eloquent and knowledgeable “advocates” follow ICJ procedures in the confines of our own campus and will look to run this again if there is interest within the society membership.
