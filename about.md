description: Information about Reigate Grammar School's MUN Conference
---

ReiMUN is the Model United Nations (MUN) conference of [Reigate Grammar School](http://www.reigategrammar.org). Now in its 22<sup>nd</sup> year, our conference hosts 300 students annually in the early Autumn term. Our 20<sup>th</sup> senior conference will be hosted on the 24<sup>th</sup> September. Information about the conference is given [here](/reimun).

The conference is aimed at secondary school students, of any abilityâ€”it aims to provide an environment in which both experienced year 13s and year 7s for whom this is their first conference feel welcome. Debates are chaired by experienced MUNers, of whom about half are from Reigate Grammar and the remainder from other schools. It is overseen by the ReiMUN Director, Thea Williams, and the student-led Secretariat. We normally have debates in 5 General Assembly committees, as well as a Security Council, and have about 60 countries.

Model United Nations is a simulation of the real United Nations, whereby each student (*delegate*) role-plays a representative of a country debating and discussing global issues. It often takes place at a *conference*, usually hosted by a school or university, when hundreds, sometimes thousands, of delegates debate and discuss global issues together.

The United Nations is the international organisation that promotes world peace and the economic and social advancement of humanity. It was founded in 1945 at the end of the Second World War by agreement between 51 countries, its first member states; it has now expanded to include 193 member states, with 2 observers.
