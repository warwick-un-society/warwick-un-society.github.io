    He has attended over 30 conferences in his seven-year MUN career in a variety of roles; highlights include being Secretary General of his school’s conference, ReiMUN, and being the President of the Special Conferences and 200 delegate plenary at MUNISH 2017. He really enjoys meeting new people from around the world, and MUN conferences provide the perfect environment for this.<br><br>
    While he is not doing MUN, he is always studying, but in the rare instances he is not doing either of these things, Aaron enjoys cooking, eating, and socialising.
    <br><br>
    Fun fact: Aaron has never eaten ice cream.
