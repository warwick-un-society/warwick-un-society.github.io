The Security Council is different from other committees:

* There are only 15 countries represented.

* You do not have to stand up when you speak.

* The style of debating is sometimes less formal.

* You consider resolutions in more detail, debating clause by clause.

* The Security Council has more power than the General Assembly, and may demand that countries do something (rather than simply request or suggest) and may threaten economic sanctions or military action if the country does not comply.

At ReiMUN, although other committees use resolution construction for Topic 1, the Security Council uses standard debate for both topics.  You should therefore prepare resolutions for both topics on the agenda.  You may also bring a resolution on a topic that is not on the agenda, if that topic is currently in the news and is a matter of international security. For help writing resolutions, go to our [guide](/resolution-writing).

## Use of the Veto

In the Security Council, P5 countries (the permanent members: China, France, Russia, UK, USA) have the power to veto any resolution.

P5 members cannot veto an individual clause, only the resolution as a whole. However, if a P5 member votes against a clause, it will be normal for the President of the Security Council to enquire as to whether the delegate will veto the whole resolution if that clause remains in place. If a veto is likely to follow, it will be normal for an informal caucus of the P5 members to take place to resolve the situation.
