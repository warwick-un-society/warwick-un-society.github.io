## Resolution Structure

The structure of a resolution is shown below:

> **Title**
>
> **Preambulatory clauses**
>
> **Operative clauses**

Note that resolutions are written as one (albeit very long and convoluted) sentence, split across many lines.

*Preambulatory clauses* (‘pre-ams’) outline the background to the resolution — the problems faced, action taken in the past by the UN on the issue, and matters to be taken into account. They are not debated by the committee, however are still needed to justify why the UN should take action. Between 5 and 8 pre-ams are normal for a resolution.

*Operative clauses* present solutions to the problem and the action the UN should take on it. These are the substance of the resolution that is debated by the committee. Between 6 and 12 operatives is normal, although this number may vary. Some conferences have maximum and minimum lengths of resolutions.

## Writing a resolution

To see how a resolution is written, we shall look at the problem of global warming. We shall look at it from the point of view of a developing country such as Mali. Start by considering the key points.

* Various gases, but particularly carbon dioxide trap heat from the sun and  cause global warming.

* Carbon dioxide is produced by industry and vehicles burning fossil fuels.

* Global warming could cause devastating effects on sea level and climate.

* At the Earth Summit, industrial nations agreed to keep carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels, but in most cases this is not being kept to.

* One way of reducing carbon dioxide production would be to introduce a carbon tax.

* It is industrialised countries that are mainly responsible for the production carbon dioxide.

* Mali is an extremely poor country so economic development is a much higher priority than environmental considerations.

These problems would be outlined in the pre-am section of the resolution. There is a list of *preambulatory phrases* [later in this Handbook](#pream-phrases); these are phrases that should be used to start each pre-am clause and should be placed in *italics*. Each pre-am clause should end in a comma. The pre-am section of the resolution might read as follows:

> *Concerned* that levels of carbon dioxide continue to rise,
>
> *Noting* that this increase is due mainly to burning of fossil fuels in industrialised countries,
>
> *Deeply concerned* that continued global warming is likely to have extremely serious environmental consequences,
>
> *Further noting* that the Earth Summit agreements are not being fully implemented,

Each phrase can only be used once, although “*Further …*” can be used a number of times. For example, you could have “*Further noting*” two or three times, but only of course if “*Noting*” has been used before.

The second part of the resolution consists of outlining how the problem could be solved. Operative clauses should be numbered and second and subsequent lines should be indented.

Returning to the problem of global warming, we might decide on the following as answers.

* Countries need to abide by the Earth Summit agreement.

* On way of reducing carbon dioxide emissions would be for the industrialised countries to introduce a carbon tax.

* Income raised by this tax could be used to assist the Less Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs) develop clean energy systems.

These ideas can then be put into the operative clauses of the resolution. There is a list of operative phrases [later in this Handbook](#operative-phrases); these should be used to start each operative clause and should also be placed in *italics*. Each operative clause should be numbered and end in a semi-colon, unless it is the final clause in which case it ends in a full stop. The operative clauses might read as follows:

> *1. Calls upon* all member states to abide by agreements made at the Earth Summit;
>
> *2. Suggests* that one way of achieving a reduction of carbon dioxide production would be for industrialised countries to introduce a carbon tax;
>
> *3. Recommends* that income raised by the carbon tax is used to assist LEDCs develop clean energy production systems.

Finally, we need to add the title of the resolution. It should contain the following:

* The name of the committee debating the resolution.

* The question (what the resolution is about – the title given on the agenda).

* The names of the submitter (the country of the person writing it).

* The names of the co-submitters (countries supporting it and who agree to vote for it).

* The UN body to which the committee reports (the General Assembly). If the resolution is for the Security Council, this should be the Security Council, since it is an independent body.

Putting this all together, we have a draft resolution which can then be lobbied.

> **COMMITTEE**: Ecology and environment
>
> **QUESTION OF**: Global Warming
>
> **SUBMITTED BY**: Mali
>
> **CO-SUBMITTED BY**:
>
> **THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY,**
>
> *Concerned* that levels of carbon dioxide continue to rise,
>
> *Noting* that this increase is due mainly to burning of fossil fuels in industrialised countries,
>
> *Deeply concerned* that continued global warming is likely to have extremely serious environmental consequences,
>
> *Further noting* that the Earth Summit agreements are not being fully implemented,
>
> *1. Calls upon* all member states to abide by agreements made at the Earth Summit;
>
> *2. Suggests* that one way of achieving a reduction of carbon dioxide production would be for industrialised countries to introduce a carbon tax;
>
> *3. Recommends* that income raised by the carbon tax is used to assist LEDCs develop clean energy production systems.

“Demand” is a phrase which can only be used by the Security Council. Strong phrases such as “condemn” are best avoided as they requires a two thirds majority to pass a resolution containing them, rather than the normal simple majority.

During debate, a resolution can be amended. If in debate you were asked a question that shows a weakness in your resolution, you can alter the resolution by making a *friendly amendment*. Other delegates can amend the resolution in open debate or in time against in a closed debate as an unfriendly amendment; this requires a vote to pass.

Clauses in a resolution may well have sub-clauses, where is is convenient to group ideas together. For example in our sample resolution on climate change, clause 2 could be broken into sub-clauses to make it more comprehensive.

> *1. Calls upon* all member states to abide by agreements made at the Earth Summit;
>
> *2. Further suggests* that some of the ways of achieving a reduction of carbon dioxide production would be for industrialised countries to:
>
> (a) introduce a carbon tax;
>
> (b) introduce subsidies for people to improve their home insulation;
>
> (c) give tax incentives to encourage industry to enhance research into alternative energy forms;
>
> *3. Recommends* that income raised by the carbon tax is used to assist LEDCs develop clean energy production systems.
