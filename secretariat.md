### Secretary General: Adrian Tam
After a year away, it is my pleasure to welcome you all to the fourteenth WarMUN conference! Having been involved in past WarMUNs myself, I know what a great conference WarMUN can be. As Secretary General, my aim is to make this conference as welcoming and fulfilling an experience as it can be. My team of secretariat members and I are working hard to ensure that this conference matches and exceeds your expectations. I hope that you enjoy your time with us over the weekend and have fun trying to solve the global issues facing the world, as well as meeting new and interesting people! I cannot wait to meet you all and give you the best conference experience we can!

### Deputy Secretary General: Ishaan Vijai


### Under-Secretary General for Chairing: Ankit Mehta
Greetings all, it is an honour to welcome you to WarMUN 2021 as the Under-Secretary General of Chairing. I have always been interested in the relationships between the social, political, and finance spheres- I carry this fascination with me as an Accounting and Finance undergraduate at Warwick. Having participated in 11 MUNs in the Middle East, I have identified the determining factors of delegate success to be confidence and critical thinking. Therefore, I am excited to observe passionate debate and the formulation of astute resolutions during the committee sessions. We wish you the best of luck, let’s make the most of it!

### Under-Secretary General for Delegates: Rafik Niftaliyev
It is my pleasure to welcome you all to the WarMUN 2021, finally in a physical format after a long wait. I am Rafik Niftaliyev and I will be serving as the Under-Secretary General for Delegates in this year’s conference. Currently a first-year PPE Student at the University of Warwick, I am deeply interested in global political developments, hence, I have dedicated myself to MUN conferences and beyond for the past few years. I am looking forward to seeing you all soon and will be happy with any enquiries or issues you have throughout the session.
