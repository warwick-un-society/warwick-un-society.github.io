#### Secretary-General: Adrian Tam
After a year away, it is my pleasure to welcome you all to the fourteenth WarMUN conference! Having been involved in past WarMUNs myself, I know what a great conference WarMUN can be. As Secretary-General, my aim is to make this conference as welcoming and fulfilling an experience as it can be. My team of secretariat members and I are working hard to ensure that this conference matches and exceeds your expectations. I hope that you enjoy your time with us over the weekend and have fun trying to solve the global issues facing the world, as well as meeting new and interesting people! I cannot wait to meet you all and give you the best conference experience we can!

#### Deputy-Secretary-General: Ishaan Vijai
It is with great pride and honour that I welcome each and every one of you to WarMUN 2021! I'm a first-year Mathematics and Philosophy student from India with a deep interest in politics and justice systems. Knowing what WarMUN has in store this fall, I can assure you that at the end of these two days, each one of you will be enriched with a newfound interest in international affairs and political discourse. You will have the coveted opportunity of meeting and interacting with similarly focused individuals that share the same goal: use WarMUN as a forum for discussions and debates for the benefit of tomorrow, while also exploring your own interests. WarMUN is truly one of a kind, and I hope to see you there!

#### Under-Secretary-General for Chairing: Ankit Mehta
Greetings all, it is an honour to welcome you to WarMUN 2021 as the Under-Secretary-General of Chairing. I have always been interested in the relationships between the social, political, and finance spheres - I carry this fascination with me as an Accounting and Finance undergraduate at Warwick. Having participated in 11 MUNs in the Middle East, I have identified the determining factors of delegate success to be confidence and critical thinking. Therefore, I am excited to observe passionate debate and the formulation of astute resolutions during the committee sessions. We wish you the best of luck, let’s make the most of it!

#### Under-Secretary-General for Delegates: Rafik Niftaliyev
It is my pleasure to welcome you all to the WarMUN 2021, finally in a physical format after a long wait. I am Rafik Niftaliyev and I will be serving as the Under-Secretary-General for Delegates in this year’s conference. Currently a first-year PPE Student at the University of Warwick, I am deeply interested in global political developments, hence, I have dedicated myself to MUN conferences and beyond for the past few years. I am looking forward to seeing you all soon and will be happy with any enquiries or issues you have throughout the session.

#### Under-Secretary-General for Finance: Haroon Khan


#### Under-Secretary-General for Outreach: Iris Bernheim


#### Under-Secretaries-General for Socials: Shaurya Dhar, Anavi Bagga


#### Under-Secretaries-General for Logistics: Jasmine Nasser, Keeley Ruane
Despite being new to the society myself, allow me to welcome you to the Warwick Model  United Nations 2021. My name is Keeley Ruane, I’m a third year English Literature student who next year will be completing an LLM in International Law and Human Rights, though some may argue (mostly Adrian) that, most importantly, I will be one half of the Under Secretary General of Logistics for the 2021 MUN here at the University of Warwick! Over the past three years, I’ve increasingly directed my academic career in line with developments from the United Nations’ OHCHR, of which such passion has been further facilitated by Warwick UN Society and Warwick’s Centre for Human Rights in Practice. Having worked for LIMUN last year and organised Cambridge International IQ Schools sixth-form MUN conferences before, I’m beyond eager to bring you the conference that not only meets your expectations but dramatically exceeds them. I can’t wait to learn something from each and every one of you!

P.S. Yes - WarMUN trumps all.

Adrian
