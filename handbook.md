This Handbook has been put together to assist delegates preparing for ReiMUN 20. Please read it carefully, and take note of all the information in it; it is vital for the smooth running of the conference that all delegates obey its instructions.

The Handbook is written with a reasonably experienced delegate in mind; delegates for whom this is their first conference should read our handbook, [My First Conference](/first). Your first MUN conference can be a daunting experience, so do read it to make sure you are fully prepared.

Finally, I hope that you all have a gainful and fun day at [Reigate Grammar School's](www.reigategrammar.org) 20<sup>th</sup> Model United Nations conference.

## Points to note

We are broadly retaining the format from ReiMUN 19 last year. Delegates may wish to note the following points:

* Topic 1 in the Social, Cultural and Humanitarian and Human Rights committees will be debated using the resolution construction procedure, which may be new to some delegates. See the info on p9. These committees will be intended for less experienced delegates.
* There will be no Opening Speeches in the General Assembly. However, there will be compulsory policy statements in committee on Topic 1.
* Topics 2 and 3 in all committees, and Topic 1 in the Disarmament and International Security, Special Political and Decolonisation and Environment committees will be debated using the more familiar Standard Debate procedure.
* Resolutions for Topics 2 and 3 will require at least five co-submitters (including the primary submitter) from at least three different schools. Resolutions should have a maximum of twelve operative clauses (including sub-clauses). There is no minimum but, as a guide, most successful resolutions have around eight to ten operative clauses.
* **Resolutions should be submitted in advance by email to <a href="mailto:secretariat@reimun.org?Subject=ReiMUN%2020%20Resolution">secretariat@reimun.org</a> by Thursday 22<sup>nd</sup> September. Delegates should bring hard copies (for lobbying purposes) and are recommended to bring them on a memory stick as well (in case you wish to amend your resolution following lobbying).**
* Committee names have been changed to reflect the names real-life General Assembly committees better.

Due to the number of delegations attending the conference, there will be five committees (not including the Security Council), but each delegation will only bring delegates for three or four of them. Your MUN co-ordinator will have been told which committees to bring delegates for.
