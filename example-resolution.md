> **COMMITTEE**: Environmental
>
> **QUESTION OF:** Global Warming
>
> **SUBMITTED BY:** United Kingdom
>
> **CO-SUBMITTED BY:**
>
>
> **THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY,**
>
> *Defining* “climate change” change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods (as given in UNFCCC),
>
> *Noting* that the current carbon dioxide level is at least 25% higher than its pre-industrial level,
>
> *Further noting* that the average global temperature has increased by 0.5°C in the last hundred years and that the 1980s and 1990s show the greatest number of warm years per decade since records began 140 years ago,
>
> *Believing that*, whereas there is no absolute proof, it can be concluded with reasonable certainty, that global warming is linked to human activity,
>
> *Deeply concerned* of the effects that continued climate change will have,
>
> *Deeply disturbed* that recent research by the Hadley Centre and its partners indicate that continued global warming will result in loss of tropical rainforest, drought and famine in arid areas, flooding in coastal areas, threat to small island states and the spread of diseases such as malaria,
>
> *Noting with optimism* that the Hadley Centre research also indicates that prompt action will mean that the worst effects of climate change will be avoided,
>
> *Noting with appreciation* the progress made at the 1997 meeting of parties to the United ￼￼Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, (held in Kyoto) in developing the Kyoto Protocol,
>
> 1. *Congratulates* those countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol;
>
> 2. *Further congratulates* those taking part in the fifth conference of parties, COP5, to the UNFCCC held in Bonn in Bonn in November 1999 for the progress made;
>
> 3. *Calls upon* all countries, that have not already done so, to sign the Kyoto Protocol as a matter of urgency;
>
> 4. *Emphasises* the comprehensive nature of the Kyoto Protocol, and in particular
>
>   1. the legally binding targets set for reduction in greenhouse emissions by developed countries;
>
>   2. the clean development mechanism allowing developing countries to make progress in terms of sustainable development;
>
>   3. the emissions trading system encouraging developed countries to assist developing countries develop clean energy systems;
>
>   4. the rigorous compliance regime;
>
> 5. *Recommends* that developed countries achieve the Kyoto Protocol targets by using the following measures:
>
>   1. carry out a review of renewable energy and set a new target to provide 10 per cent of the electricity needs from renewable energy sources as soon as possible, but hopefully by 2020;
>
>   2. introduce legislation that includes powers for Government to set energy efficiency standards of performance, requiring the gas and electricity companies to encourage and assist customers to use less energy;
>
>   3. introduce an integrated transport policy as a framework for a whole range of measures which will deliver a better quality transport system with lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions;
>
>   4. introduce a new vehicle excise duty system which benefits those driving smaller, more efficient cars, and also changes the company car tax system to remove incentives for people to drive more and encourage people to buy more fuel efficient cars;
>
>   5. introduce an improved fuel poverty programme which should ensure that old people, the disabled, children and people with health difficulties have properly insulated and heated homes and will have the additional benefit of also saving Carbon emissions; introduce a new climate change levy which will encourage businesses to use energy more efficiently, but at the same time, recognise the legitimate concerns of energy intensive industries and offer the prospect of a significantly lower rate of levy to those sectors which enter into agreements to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions;
>
>   6. to work with business to develop a domestic emissions trading scheme in advance of the launch of the international system, so allowing business to reduce carbon emissions more cost-effectively;
>
> 6. *Considering* that the measures outlined in clause 5 will allow Kyoto targets to be ￼￼achieved without seriously effecting the economy;
>
> 7. *Encourages* governments to develop improved, appropriate public education programmes in order for people to be better informed about the consequences of climate change;
>
> 8. *Decides* to remain seized of this matter.
