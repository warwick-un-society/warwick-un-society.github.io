> **COMMITTEE**: Environmental
>
> **QUESTION OF:** Global Warming
>
> **SUBMITTED BY:** United Kingdom
>
> **CO-SUBMITTED BY:**
>
>
> **THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY,**
>
> *Defining* “climate change” change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods (as given in UNFCCC),
>
> *Noting* that the current carbon dioxide level is at least 25% higher than its pre-industrial level,
>
> *Further noting* that the average global temperature has increased by 0.5°C in the last hundred years and that the 1980s and 1990s show the greatest number of warm years per decade since records began 140 years ago,
>
> *Believing that*, whereas there is no absolute proof, it can be concluded with reasonable certainty, that global warming is linked to human activity,
>
> *Deeply concerned* of the effects that continued climate change will have,
>
> *Deeply disturbed* that recent research by the Hadley Centre and its partners indicate that continued global warming will result in loss of tropical rainforest, drought and famine in arid areas, flooding in coastal areas, threat to small island states and the spread of diseases such as malaria,
>
> *Noting with optimism* that the Hadley Centre research also indicates that prompt action will mean that the worst effects of climate change will be avoided,
>
> *Noting with appreciation* the progress made at the 1997 meeting of parties to the United ￼￼Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, (held in Kyoto) in developing the Kyoto Protocol,
>
> 1. *Congratulates* those countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol;
>
> 2. *Further congratulates* those taking part in the fifth conference of parties, COP5, to the UNFCCC held in Bonn in Bonn in November 1999 for the progress made;
>
> 3. *Calls upon* all countries, that have not already done so, to sign the Kyoto Protocol as a matter of urgency;
>
> 4. *Emphasises* the comprehensive nature of the Kyoto Protocol, and in particular
>
>   1. the legally binding targets set for reduction in greenhouse emissions by developed countries;
>
>   2. the clean development mechanism allowing developing countries to make progress in terms of sustainable development;
>
>   3. the emissions trading system encouraging developed countries to assist developing countries develop clean energy systems;
>
>   4. the rigorous compliance regime;
>
> 5. *Recommends* that developed countries achieve the Kyoto Protocol targets by using the following measures:
>
>   1. carry out a review of renewable energy and set a new target to provide 10 per cent of the electricity needs from renewable energy sources as soon as possible, but hopefully by 2020;
>
>   2. introduce legislation that includes powers for Government to set energy efficiency standards of performance, requiring the gas and electricity companies to encourage and assist customers to use less energy;
>
>   3. introduce an integrated transport policy as a framework for a whole range of measures which will deliver a better quality transport system with lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions;
>
>   4. introduce a new vehicle excise duty system which benefits those driving smaller, more efficient cars, and also changes the company car tax system to remove incentives for people to drive more and encourage people to buy more fuel efficient cars;
>
>   5. introduce an improved fuel poverty programme which should ensure that old people, the disabled, children and people with health difficulties have properly insulated and heated homes and will have the additional benefit of also saving Carbon emissions; introduce a new climate change levy which will encourage businesses to use energy more efficiently, but at the same time, recognise the legitimate concerns of energy intensive industries and offer the prospect of a significantly lower rate of levy to those sectors which enter into agreements to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions;
>
>   6. to work with business to develop a domestic emissions trading scheme in advance of the launch of the international system, so allowing business to reduce carbon emissions more cost-effectively;
>
> 6. *Considering* that the measures outlined in clause 5 will allow Kyoto targets to be ￼￼achieved without seriously effecting the economy;
>
> 7. *Encourages* governments to develop improved, appropriate public education programmes in order for people to be better informed about the consequences of climate change;
>
> 8. *Decides* to remain seized of this matter.

*Immediately after the Operative clauses have been read…*

> **Germany**: Point of order.

The Chair should accept a point of order at this time.

> Is it in order that a pre-am phrase is used in clause 6?

This is not in order — the Chair should suggest a friendly amendment to “Considers” — if not, UK please make the suggestion. The UK should then be offered the floor.

> **United Kingdom**: We are all aware of the problems caused by global warming. The Panel on Climate Change predicts a temperature increase of between 1 and 3.5°C. This could cause a sea level rise of 15 to 95 cm, which would cause widespread flooding. A rise of 100cm would displace 70 million people. Salt water would flow into rivers contaminating fresh water supplies and effect fishing. There would be more droughts, water shortages and wildfires.
>
> Last year in the USA there were a number of deaths caused by heat waves; this situation could only become worse.
>
> Tropical diseases such as malaria would spread as carrying organisms move into new areas.

> There is substantial evidence that this warming is already under way.
>
> The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which opened for signing at the 1992 Earth Summit, tackled the problem of global warming and has been widely ratified. Not all countries have achieved the targets agreed.
>
> Even if the limits set in the UNFCCC are met, it will not prevent the dangerous effects of global warming. That is why a new set of targets were agreed at the Kyoto conference.
>
> The Kyoto Protocol sets legally binding targets for developed countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases by five per cent. There are no constraints on developing countries, and in addition it provides a mechanism that encourages sustainable development. It is a vital agreement and it is important that all countries sign it. This resolution calls for that support.

￼￼￼￼The Chair should call for the delegate to yield any time now — when they do see the end of the speech.
￼
> This resolution also sets out practical measures that would enable developed countries to achieve the reduction in emissions that are so necessary. These proposals have already been put into effect in the United Kingdom and have met with great success in reducing greenhouse emissions. We particularly believe that private companies must be encouraged to take a full part in achieving reductions in greenhouse emissions. This can be done through a combination of cooperation and legislation.
>
> This is a comprehensive and effective resolution. Please support it. I yield to points.

The Chair should find that this is in order and ask for points.

> **Argentina**: Do you agree that this resolution provides a combination of a broad perspective and practical detail?
>
> **United Kingdom**: I certainly do. That is an excellent point. The Kyoto agreement in itself provides a broad solution to this problem and clause 5 outlines exactly how developing countries can achieve this.
>
> I yield the floor to Canada.

The Chair should find that this is in order.

> **Canada**: This is a strong and comprehensive resolution. One of its key points is in calling for all countries to sign the Kyoto Protocol. Another very important point is that it proposes to increase the level of popular understanding through education. Canada believes that international issues such as global warming do need to be understood by all members of the global community.
>
> I yield to points.

The Chair should find that this is in order and ask for points.

> **Iceland**: Canada, you picked out clause 7 promoting education, but this clause has no specific suggestions as to how it should be done. Do you not think that this clause needs to contain more specific detail?
>
> **Canada**: No, Iceland, I do not agree. Yes, this resolution could be filled here with a long, long section of sub-clauses listing everything from Internet to billboards, but as we are encouraged to make resolutions shorter, I do not consider it necessary. The meaning is clear. Let us please credit governments with the intelligence of deciding the best means for themselves. For developed countries this would no doubt include television and the internet, whereas in Africa education programs directed through village elders are far more effective.
>
> I yield the floor to Mali.

The Chair should find that this is in order.

> **Mali**: Mali encourages developing countries to sign the Kyoto Protocol as this is a way of achieving sustainable development and that is of course one of our main aims.
>
>I yield to points.

The Chair should find that this is in order and ask for points.

> **India**: Does the delegate from Mali not think that this resolution does little apart from advising everyone to sign the Kyoto Protocol with a few quickly thought of suggestions thrown in?
>
> **Mali**: I disagree. Even if it were the case, however, I feel it would still be worthwhile reminding certain nations that it would be a good idea to sign the Protocol since it is such a strong agreement.
>
> I yield the floor to Japan.

The Chair should find that this is NOT in order since there have already been two yields. The floor should return to the Chair.

If the Chair allows the yield —

> **India**: Point of Order — Is it in order to have three yields?

The Chair should now select the next speaker.

> **USA**: I have an amendment. Add a new clause 7 and then renumber the current clause 7 and 8. The new clause should read “Calls upon developing countries to cap their emissions at 10% higher than they are at present.”
>
>There seems little point in the developed countries cutting back their emissions if there is no commitment at all for the developing countries. Whereas we accept that developing countries need to be allowed to develop, there should be limitations on how much that should be allowed to damage the environment. Let us remember that it has been agreed that we need sustainable development. This amendment allows room for development, but puts limits on just how much damage should result from it.
>
> I yield the floor to the Chair.

The Chair should then ask if anyone else wishes to speak for the amendment with a minute remaining.

In the absence of anyone else to speak for it, time against will begin.

> **China** (Against): Of the accumulated greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, 74% has come from the industrialised countries, and 28% from Guess who? Yes, it’s the United States. Yes 74% of pollutants are produced by 20% of the world’s population. The main priority of developing countries is to improve the dreadful living standards that their people endure. We have actually had all these arguments at the Earth summit, and it was agreed not to restrict developing countries. If countries like the USA want to stop emissions rising they can help us develop clean technology — we look forward to their funding. Let us not go back to these old arguments. Vote against this amendment.
>
> I yield the floor to the Chair.

The Chair should then ask if anyone else wishes to speak against the amendment with a minute remaining.

In the absence of anyone else to speak against it, voting on the amendment will take place.

> VOTING:
>
> | For | Against |
> | --- | ------- |
> | 12  | 78      |

The floor should now return to the United States since the amendment failed.

> **USA**: I am disappointed that delegates did not wish to make this a much stronger resolution by incorporating my amendment. I yield the floor to the Chair.

> **Chad**: This is a stupid resolution. There are many factors linked with environmental considerations that are of greater importance.

The Chair should stop Chad and ask the delegate to rephrase their statement. If this does not happen — UK — please make a Point of Order. The Chair should also make a note of this, as individual awards are not given to delegates using non-diplomatic language.

> This resolution is weak because it is limited in its consideration. One of our main concerns is desertification. It is linked to some extent to global warming, but this resolution does nothing for about it. Our people are being affected now by the process of desertification and it needs an answer now. 135 million people are directly affected by desertification.
>
> I yield to points

The Chair should find that this is in order and ask for points.

> **Sudan**: Does the speaker not agree that problems of starvation should take priority over haggling about CO<sub>2</sub> trade-offs?
>
> **Chad**: Exactly. Emissions trading is simply an excuse that means industrialised countries can carry on churning out just as much CO2 as they did before.
>
> **Belgium**: Does the speaker not realise that desertification is due to misuse of soil rather than global warming?
>
> **Chad**: Don’t you listen? I said it is linked to some extent.
>
> **Belgium**: Point of order.
>
>Is it in order to suggest that I was not listening?

The Chair should decide that this is not in order. The Chair might ask to delegate to leave the floor since this is the second time insulting language has been used, or at least warn that that they will lose the floor if it happens again.

If Chad has lost the floor go straight to where Sudan takes the floor below.

---

> **France**: Point of Order.
>
>Is it in order for Chad to suggest that there is some link between global warming and desertification when there is in fact none?
>
> **Sudan**: Point of Order.
>
> Is it in order for France to claim there is no link between global warming and desertification, when spread of desert means loss of vegetation resulting in higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub>?

The Chair should point out that Chad suggested that global warming to some extent causes desertification, which is untrue, and therefore Chad should withdraw that remark.

> **Chad**: My main point is that there should be greater priority given to the more immediate problems. I thank Sudan for the point of order. If desertification leads to greater CO<sub>2</sub> levels and therefore increased global warming, why is it not mentioned in this resolution?
>
> I yield the floor to Sudan.

The Chair should find that this is in order.

---

> **Sudan**: Sudan agrees in principle with the points made by Chad. But let us look at the Kyoto agreement. The industrialised countries have come up with wonderful agreement that if they assist us to build an environmentally friendly plant, they subtract that from their own emissions. Ridiculous! How can you have reduced your emissions if you have not?
>
> I yield to points.

> **Belgium**: Surely the emissions trading system encourages sustainable development and is therefore helpful to developing countries. Do you not agree?
>
> **Sudan**: I would rather see the development take place and the developed countries reducing the amount polluting gas they turn out.
>
> I yield the floor to Sri Lanka.

The Chair should find that this is in order

> **Sri Lanka**: The Kyoto Protocol sounds wonderful doesn’t it? But let’s consider it more carefully. There is the emissions trading system. How does it work in detail?
>
> Well, of course, that has not been finalised yet. The present programme hopes to put the operational mechanisms in place at the sixth meeting of the parties, COP-6 as it is called, to the UNFCCC that is not due to take place until November 2000.
>
> To Sri Lanka it does not make sense to sign the Protocol until the detail has been worked out. Therefore I propose an amendment. I propose that clause 3 should read “Calls upon all countries that have not already done so to consider signing after the sixth meeting of the parties to the UNFCCC”.
>
> The Kyoto Protocol recommends reductions in emissions for developed countries. Specific reductions for specific countries have been agreed, but what happens if the country does not achieve its targets? We don’t know!
>
> Forests are a key factor for reducing the level of CO<sub>2</sub> in the air. How will the presence of large forest areas in a country be accounted for by this system? We don’t know!
>
> I think we need a breathing space to wait and see how the system develops. I hope therefore that you will accept this amendment. I yield to points.
>
> **Canada**: Does the speaker not realise that it is perfectly in order to sign a Convention before detail has been sorted out?
>
> **Sri Lanka**: I think that it is important to know exactly how the Protocol will work in practice before it is signed. I yield the floor to the Chair.

The Chair should then ask if anyone else wishes to speak for the amendment with a minute remaining.

In the absence of anyone else to speak for it, time against will begin.

> **United Kingdom** (Against): The signing of a Convention or Protocol means that the country agrees with the principles contained within it. It is not a commitment to do anything — the commitment comes with ratification. Are countries here really against the principles of protecting the environment? Are countries here really in favour of unrestrained emissions. I don’t think so. Please agree with principle of Kyoto and throw out this amendment. I yield the floor to the Chair.


> VOTING:
>
> | For | Against |
> | --- | ------- |
> | 42  | 48      |

The floor should now return to Sri Lanka since the amendment failed.

> **Sri Lanka**: Sri Lanka is disappointed that the General Assembly felt unable to uphold an amendment that would have made the resolution more acceptable to a number of countries. I yield the floor to the Chair.
>
> **Argentina**: I have an amendment. Add a new clause 7 and then renumber the current clause 7 and 8. The new clause should read “Urges all countries to work towards fulfilling the obligations of the Kyoto Protocol;”.
>
> Let us remember that even if countries sign the Kyoto Protocol, it will not come into effect until all the measures are in place and it has the correct number of ratifications. Some countries still have not met their commitments to the Earth Summit agreements. This amendment strengthens the resolution because the topic is global warming not just the Kyoto Protocol. The Earth Summit had greater support than the Kyoto Protocol does at present, and this amendment by Argentina urges action on global warming alongside the Kyoto agreements.
>
> I yield the floor to the Chair.

The Chair should then ask if anyone else wishes to speak for the amendment with a minute remaining.

In the absence of anyone else to speak for it, time against will begin.

> **Norway**: I have an amendment to the amendment. The new clause 7 should continue “--- and in particular for each country to make the main part of its reduction through domestic energy, industry and transport sectors rather than through emission trading.”
>
> Whereas Norway supports the principle of industrialised countries helping developing countries develop clean energy systems, we feel that it would be an abuse of the trading system if countries do not attempt to reduce their own emissions. This amendment makes this principle clear and addresses the concerns expressed by Chad and Sudan earlier on the debate.
>
> I yield the floor to the Chair.

The Chair should then ask if anyone else wishes to speak against the amendment to the amendment with a minute remaining.

In the absence of anyone else to speak against it, voting on the amendment to the amendment will take place.

The Chair should explain that the first vote will be on the amendment to the amendment, and that if this passes, the amendment also passes. If the first vote does not pass, there will then be a vote on the amendment itself.

> VOTING:
>
> | For | Against |
> | --- | ------- |
> | 57  | 33      |

The amendment to the amendment and the amendment pass. The floor
should now go to the Chair.

> **Iceland**: Call to Move the Previous Question.

> **Argentina**: Seconded.
>
> **Zimbabwe**: Objection.

Moving the Previous Question is a call to go straight to a vote on the resolution. It must have a seconder. Since there is an objection it must go to a vote.

> VOTING:
>
> | For | Against |
> | --- | ------- |
> | 48  | 42      |

The Chair should find that this motion fails because it did not achieve the two thirds majority required.

> **Zimbabwe**: Zimbabwe would like to ask — what does this resolution do for developing countries? Now we all know what the Kyoto Protocol may or may not do, but what does this resolution do?
>
> We have a nice long section on how the lucky, wealthy industrialised countries can achieve their commitments if they decide to bother, but what does it do for Zimbabwe? What does it do for Cameroon or Chad or Ethiopia or The Gambia or India or......., I could go on and on. It does nothing.
>
> We have in this resolution the consideration that we always get from these rich countries — none. I urge you to vote against a flawed resolution or at least abstain.
>
> I yield to points.

The Chair should find that this is in order and ask for points.

> **USA**: The Kyoto Protocol provides for developing countries for achieve sustainable development. Surely that is something Zimbabwe would appreciate?
>
> **Zimbabwe**: If as a result of Kyoto we are assisted by the United States to further our development of course we would appreciate that. Let’s see what happens. My point is that this resolution itself does nothing for us.
>
> I yield to points.

The Chair should find that this is in order and ask for points.

> **Chad**: Does Zimbabwe agree that when investment in developing countries does actually happen, that it rarely comes to African countries where the real need is?
>
> **Zimbabwe**: Yes. Thank you, Chad. At last we have someone who understands the situation. I hope we do see benefits from Kyoto, but I suspect it will go to the Tigers again so that the industrialised countries can make quick profit yet again. This resolution does nothing about our development.
>
> I yield to points.

The Chair should find that this is in order and ask for points.

> **United Kingdom**: [Your main point is to put to Zimbabwe that it should be trying to amend\* the resolution, but see how many points you can squeeze in] The point of this resolution is that it calls for countries to support the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol could be of immense value to developing countries. For example, you need to be able to supply your people with energy. The Kyoto Protocol encourages the industrialised countries to help with this through the emissions trading system. It could improve your production base by providing the mechanism whereby industrialised countries are encouraged to build these for you.
>
> \*Why don’t you make an amendment rather than be destructive of the resolution?
>
> **Zimbabwe**: I can assure you that I would make an amendment if there was sufficient in it to make that worthwhile, but I do not think there is.
>
> I yield the floor to India.

The Chair should find that this is in order.

> **India**: I have an amendment. Clause 3 should replace “sign” with “ratify”.
>
The Kyoto Protocol requires 55 ratifications, including those developed countries responsible for 55% of the 1990 CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, before it can enter into force. There seems to be little point in signing it if it is not allowed to do anything, and it cannot do anything until countries ratify it. The amendment seems a logical correction.
>
>I yield the floor to the Chair.

The Chair should then ask if anyone else wishes to speak for the amendment with a minute remaining.

In the absence of anyone else to speak for it, time against will begin.

> **Canada** (Against): As I am sure India is aware, the process of ratification requires changing national law. For a highly industrialised country, such as Canada, which has undertaken cut its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by well over the 5% requirement, this is a considerable task. We, and other developed countries are working towards this, however, and we hope to be able to ratify the Protocol in the near future. It cannot be done at once, and it is more important to encourage countries to agree to the principles, so I ask countries to reject the amendment.
>
> I yield the floor to the United Kingdom.

￼The Chair should find that this is in order with about one minute remaining.

> **United Kingdom** (Against): This is strange. India is calling for the Kyoto Protocol to be ratified when it has not even signed the agreement. Is this a change of heart? I think not. Industrialised countries are working towards ratification as Canada pointed out, but they are not in a position to do so at present. If ratification is called for, it will make it impossible for the industrialised countries to support the resolution. This is a badly disguised wrecking amendment. Please vote against it.
>
> I yield the floor to the Chair.

The Chair should find this in order. Time will have almost run out on the amendment, so voting should take place.

> VOTING:
>
> | For | Against |
> | --- | ------- |
> | 25  | 65      |

The floor should now return to India since the amendment failed.

> **India**: It is a pity that the General Assembly voted against an amendment which would have helped strengthen the resolution and would have perhaps have made it almost acceptable.

**Time has now elapsed**

The Chair should now call for voting procedures on the resolution. The Chair should remind delegates that they may abstain in voting on the resolution.

> VOTING:
>
> | For | Against | Abstentions |
> | --- | ------- | ----------- |
> | 43  | 40      | 7           |
> **Chad**: Division of the House.

The Chair should decide against a Division of the House because this would only be considered if the resolution had failed.
