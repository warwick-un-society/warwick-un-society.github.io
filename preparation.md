description: How to prepare for Model United Nations Debates
---

You will need to start with a team meeting to decide which member of the team (or delegate) will take part in which particular committee.

Each committee will have an agenda and the first stage is to research the issues on the agenda. For example a social committee might have euthanasia, genetic engineering and the problem of illicit drugs on it agenda, and the delegate sitting on this committee would need to research each of these issues.

The next stage is to find out about the country the team (or delegation) is representing. Gather information on the type of government, economy, geography, history, language(s) and culture.

Information can be found on [the World Factbook](http://www.theodora.com/wfb/abc_world_fact_book.html) and on [the UN website](http://www.un.org/en/members/). Now put the first two stages together and work out your country’s policy on each item on the agenda.

## Policy Statement

Having established what the policy of your country is on an issue, you should then convert this to a policy statement. A policy statement should contain the following:

* An outline of the particular issue.

* Reference to the main documents on the issue.

* A statement of the country’s position on the issue.

* Suggestions for a solution to the problem.

Each delegate will need to prepare a policy statement of about 45 seconds on Topic 1 for their committee. You may find it useful to prepare policy statements on Topics 2 and 3 as well, as this will help you to clarify your position on the issue.

Below are some example policy statements, so that you can get an idea of the kind of thing you might want to say.

> Country: **Sweden**
>
> Topic: **Provision of primary education**
>
> Sweden believes strongly in education for all.  Education is essential for citizens to develop the skills needed to be productive in adult life.  Sweden has compulsory education for all children aged 7 to 16.  We believe that this has helped our country to become prosperous.  
>
> Sweden believes that all countries should make the provision of free primary education for all children a priority.  Some countries struggle to provide free education, and Sweden believes that the richer countries in the world should be willing to provide financial support in order to enable this to happen.  Countries with more educated people are more prosperous and able to trade more, so it is in the interests of richer countries to help poorer countries educate their citizens, so that they can trade with them.  Education is also the best way to prevent human rights abuses, to prevent the exploitation of children, and to promote the well-being of women and girls throughout the world.

> Country: **Saudi Arabia**
>
> Topic:  **Exploitation of women**
>
> Saudi Arabia is an Islamic kingdom and follows the teachings of the Qur’an and the principles of Sharia law.  Islam teaches the protection of women by their male relatives, to safeguard them against being exploited.
>
> Saudi Arabia rejects the Western idea that women and men are the same.  It is because we understand that men and women have different roles and obligations in life that we protect our women from having to fend for themselves in a man’s world.  Saudi Arabia condemns the exploitation of women practised in Western countries, which encourage women to excite men’s sexual desires.  Saudi Arabia calls for the honour and dignity of women to be preserved and defended in all countries.


## Resolutions

The Policy Statement can then be used to produce a resolution. Delegates should aim to write a resolution for each issue on the committee. The process of producing a resolution is shown at the top of the next page. You should bring resolutions prepared in advance for Topics 2 and 3. Resolutions for Topic 1 will be constructed on the day, so do not need to be prepared in advance.

<!--### Resolutions

Writing a resolution for topic 2 is not compulsory, especially if you are an inexperienced delegate, but it is advised.) For help on how to write a resolution, see [later in this Handbook](#resolution-writing).

Once you have written your resolution you should:

* Check that it is properly formatted (title, pre-amble, operative clauses, grammar and punctuation correct)

* E-mail it to resolutions@reimun.org or upload it [on our website](/uploader). The resolution should be in a format that we can read (i.e. Google Docs, Open Document, Word, Pages, PDF or plaintext), and have a minimum of 6 operative clauses, ideally about 8, maximum 12.

* Print out some hard copies to bring to conference for lobbying purposes (for notes on lobbying, see our document ‘[My First Conference](/at-conference)’).

You do not need to bring in a memory stick with the resolution on unless you intend to submit it late (in which case it will have significantly less chance of being debated), since we will make all resolutions available on Google Drive.

Before they can be debated resolutions must be approved by the Approvals Panel. This will ensure that resolutions are correctly written and formatted; it will not judge the content of the resolution. A list of approved resolutions will be put up outside the approvals panel room at 10.20; if your resolution has not been approved you may re-submit it.-->

## Support and Opposition

It is worthwhile researching the position of other countries on various issues. This will give you an idea of who will support you in debate and those likely to oppose you.
