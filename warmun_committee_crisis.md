## Crisis Director: Nicholas Sim

Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.

Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished.

Itâ€™s been 70 years since the Air Nomads were wiped from existence and with the Avatar still gone, the 100 Year War has continued raging between the Fire Nation and the Earth Kingdom and Water Tribe Coalition.

The Fire Nation is continuing their expansion into the Earth Kingdom, on their way to world domination. The Coalition plans to finally strike back against the Fire Nation and restore balance to the world.

<b> Set in the World of Avatar: The Last Airbender </b>
