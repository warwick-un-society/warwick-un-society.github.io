Warwick UN Society offers weekly training sessions that will teach members of all skill levels the fundamentals of Model United Nations such as the different Rules of Procedure, public speaking skills and resolution writing. Training aims to not only empower people with the confidence to participate in local and international conferences but also the crucial skill of critical thinking when it comes to crafting concrete solutions to the topics at hand.

Besides the societyâ€™s weekly meetings, Training also organizes termly UN / Crisis councils that will simulate the full experience of a real life conference. We will also be holding Chairing seminars for experienced delegates that are looking to take that next step in their MUN careers.
