Warwick UN Society offers weekly training sessions that will teach members of all skill levels the fundamentals of Model United Nations such as the different Rules of Procedure, public speaking skills and resolution writing. Training aims to not only empower people with the confidence to participate in local and international conferences but also the crucial skill of critical thinking when it comes to crafting concrete solutions to the topics at hand.

Besides the society’s weekly meetings, Training also organizes termly UN / Crisis councils that will simulate the full experience of a real life conference. We will also be holding Chairing seminars for experienced delegates that are looking to take that next step in their MUN careers.

This year, as we are in an unfortunate situation with the pandemic, Warwick UN Society Training will be moving online to help prevent any spreading of the virus as well as better facilitate a platform for all its members who understandably cannot be on campus to still attend weekly training sessions and engage with the many problems of today’s world.
