<b>Topics:</b>
<br>
  1. Addressing the monopolisation of global tech markets, the break up of tech giants

Following rapid developments within the tech industry and building on international perspectives such as the US Big 4 antitrust report, the monopolisation of global tech markets represents a relevant and pressing issue. As the ever-shifting confines of digital possibilities represent issues of anti-competition, anti-trust and natural market operations, the economic and social consequences are consequently levied non-discriminatorily against citizens in all member nations. WarMUN ECOSOCâ€™21 thus will touch upon which global frameworks we have always believed in, whether we should continue believing in them, and why.

  2. Increasing access to technical and vocational education in Latin America and the Carribean

Nowadays, with globalization and the global workforce becoming more dependent on interactions between humans and technology, technical and vocational education is almost essential for school-to-work transitions and upward career paths. This topic has been selected primarily because the issue of most people not having the 'luxury' of worker training has been persistent in Latin America and the Caribbean for far too long (and is likely to be sustained without further substantial action), thereby contributing to slow and negative economic growth rates in said regions, which only exacerbates living standards and mainline concerns such as world hunger, crime and unsound institutions.
