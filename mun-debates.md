Debates begin officially with the person who submits a resolution reading out the **operative clauses**.

In **closed debate** the chair will then announce the time allowed FOR and AGAINST this resolution: — “<u>The Chair proposes ten minutes for and ten minutes against the resolution.</u>”

In **open debate** the chair will announce the overall time allowed: “<u>The Chair proposes twenty minutes of open debate.</u>”

The delegate submitting the resolution then begins.

The speaker may invite questions at any time while they have the floor saying “<u>I yield to points of information</u>”. The chair will then select a delegate wishing to ask a question. For example:

> **Speaker**: I yield to Points of Information.
>
> **Chair**: The speaker has yielded to points. France, you have been recognised. Please rise and state your point.

A **Point of Information** must be put to the speaker who has the floor, and must be a question. The time taken to ask the question is not included in the debate time, but the time for the answer is taken into account. Points of information may be for or against the resolution. It is usual for a speaker to yield to points at some stage while holding the floor.

When a speaker has finished they may:

1. Allow the chair to choose the next speaker — “I yield the floor to the chair”, or

2. Hand on to another speaker as previously arranged — “I yield the floor to Italy”

It is usual for the Chair to restrict yielding to other delegates, perhaps allowing only one or two such yields at a time.

## Closed Debate

Closed debate starts with time FOR the resolution. In this time only delegates supporting the resolution may speak, although points of information may be FOR or AGAINST When time FOR the resolution has elapsed, then time AGAINST begins. This takes place in exactly the same way as time FOR, with speakers explaining their opposition to a resolution and picking out weaknesses in it, and submitting to points when they choose. Again, the points of information may be FOR (with delegates challenging the speaker on their views), or AGAINST (with delegates supporting the speaker in their opposition to the resolution).

When the speaker has finished, they may yield the floor to the Chair or to another delegate.

Any amendment which has not been accepted by the submitter must be proposed during time AGAINST as an **unfriendly amendment**, and, if and when the Chair decides, will be debated. To propose an amendment, a delegate should submit it in writing to the Chair on a provided amendment sheet, and then wait to be recognised. The time allocated to consider an amendment is usually two minutes FOR and two minutes AGAINST. At the end of this time, the amendment is voted on, with delegates voting FOR or AGAINST; there are no ABSTENTIONS on an amendment.

## Open Debate

In open debate delegates are encouraged to be “<u>as positive as possible about a resolution</u>”, and it is suggested that delegates propose amendments rather than simply oppose a resolution. Amendments may be considered at any time during open debate provided that a written copy of the amendment has been submitted to the Chair and that the Chair has recognised the delegate wishing to propose the amendment.

*Note: ReiMUN conferences usually use Open Debate format. However, the style of debate is at the individual Chair’s discretion.*


## Points

The following points may be raised by delegates during a debate, and relate directly to the debate itself.

A **Point of Personal Privilege** refers to the well being of a delegate. It may not refer to the resolution. It may only interrupt a speaker if the speech is inaudible. This is the only point that may interrupt a speaker.

A **Point of Information** is a question and must be made as a question. It can only be made when the speaker has yielded to points. It can be made to the speaker or to the Chair.

A **Point of Order** is a question about procedure. It has to be addressed to the Chair. It can be made during a pause in a speech.

A **Point of Parliamentary Enquiry** is a question to the Chair about the rules of procedure.

**Orders of the Day** is a call to return to the main topic of the debate.

**Permission to Approach the Chair** is a request to discuss a problem with the Chair privately.

**Explain Vote** is a request, after a vote, by a delegate to explain the way each delegate voted. Usually one for each FOR, AGAINST and ABSTAINED would be given half a minute.

## Parliamentary Procedure

The following points may be raised by delegates during a debate, however relate to parliamentary procedure and not directly to the debate.

**Move to Extend Debate Time** is a request to have further time FOR and AGAINST a resolution. It should have a seconder. If anyone objects, it is put to a vote (without debate), a simple majority being required.

**Move to Table** is used to propose a stop to consideration of a resolution if that resolution clearly has little support and would be a waste of time to debate fully. It should have a seconder. If anyone objects, it is put to a vote (without debate), a simple majority being required.

**Move the Previous Question** is a call to end debate time and to vote on the resolution. It should have a seconder. If anyone objects, it is put to a vote (without debate), a two-thirds majority being required.

**Move to Adjourn** is a proposal to finish proceedings. It should have a seconder. If anyone objects, it is put to a vote (without debate) a simple majority being required.

**Refer the Question** is a proposal to send a resolution to be considered by another committee. It should have a seconder. If anyone objects it is debated (3 minutes FOR and 3 minutes AGAINST) and is then put to a vote, a simple majority being required.

## ￼Duties of Delegates
<b><i>All delegates must:

<b><i> 1. respect the decision of the Chair at all times;

<b><i> 2. obtain the floor before speaking;

<b><i> 3. stand when speaking;

<b><i> 4. yield the floor when required to do so by the Chair;

<b><i> 5. be courteous at all times;

<b><i> 6. avoid the use of insulting or abusive language.

## Additional Information

Delegates at an MUN conference are taking the role of diplomats, and so it is important for them to behave in a diplomatic manner, showing politeness and courtesy at all times, even when they strongly disagree with another delegate.

Diplomacy is particularly important when considering resolutions. A resolution represents a great deal of work by a student and should be respected as such. Any delegate referring to a resolution or part of a resolution in a derogatory way will be ruled out of order, and delegates making comments such as, “This resolution is useless” will be reprimanded, and may well lose possession of the floor.

It is assumed that if a resolution proposes financing a project through the United Nations, that it will be funded by the UN. This means that a resolution containing such a proposal may not be criticised during debate on the basis of its financial implications.

The General Assembly is a body that is not able to enforce its decisions; its authority lies in the weight of opinion behind its decisions. Resolutions to be debated in the General Assembly or one of its committees may not “demand”, but may “recommend,” “urge” or “request”. Delegates should therefore avoid criticising a resolution for being weak because it only uses phrases such as these.

## Points about Debate Style

When speaking, remember:

* Make sure you are speaking about the particular resolution under discussion, and not just the general issue.

* Talk in the third person — “Sweden believes that…” not “I think that…”

* Address your speech to the Chair, not to other delegates.

* At the end of your speech, say, “I open myself to points of information” (so that people can ask you questions). After questions are finished, say either “I yield the floor to the Chair” (if you want the Chair to choose the next speaker) or “I yield the floor to [another country]” if you want to choose the next speaker (e.g. one of your co-submitters).

When making points of information, remember:

* Stand up in your place to make your point, and stay standing until the person has answered.

* It must be a question and must be about what the person has just said.

* Ask the question to the Chair not to the delegate (e.g. not “Do you think...?” but “Does the delegate of Syria believe that…?”

* If you feel they haven’t answered your question, or want to respond to their answer, you may ask for a *right of reply* so that you can make a second point of information. You must ask the Chair for permission. Speaking without the Chair’s permission is called *dialogue* and is not permitted on the floor at any time.
