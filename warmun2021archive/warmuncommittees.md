>## Age of Uncertainty: Rebuilding Trust, Restoring Hope

The world as we know it today seems unrecognisable compared to what it was less than two years ago. Successive crises have increased tension around the world and has weakened our trust in each other. From the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to the climate crisis, and to the recent political and security upheavals in Afghanistan, it is essential for the United Nations to tackle these enduring and emerging problems and to restore peoples' trust in global cooperation and diplomacy.

Our committee selections and their topics aim to reflect this changing reality, challenging delegates to find new and innovative ways to confront these global issues, and make a positive change on the world.
