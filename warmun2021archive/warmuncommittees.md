>## A World Without War: Peacebuilding and Conflict Resolution

The world as we know it has been rapidly changing over the last few years. Crises have arisen around the world, leading to increased breakdowns in diplomacy and the failure of nations to trust one another. The COVID-19 pandemic hit the world hard, the climate crisis has continued to escalate, war has broken out in Europe, conflict remains unresolved in the Middle East and beyond, and inflation is continuing to grow and devastate economies. The member states of the United Nations must step up to the plate and find solutions to the issues ahead of us and restore the world to one of diplomacy and cooperation rather than a world of conflict and fear.
