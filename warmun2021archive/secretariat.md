    <h4>Secretary-General: Adrian Tam</h4>
    
Adrian is a final-year Politics, Philosophy and Law student at the University of Warwick, serving as the Secretary-General for WarMUN 2021. An avid Star Wars fan, he is capable of holding far-reaching and perhaps rather boring conversations on Star Wars lore and their wider implications on the galaxy far, far away... as participants of the Warwick UN Society Star Wars Crisis will know. Adrian looks forward to welcoming delegates to the new and improved WarMUN and hopes that everyone will have a great weekend.

    <h4>Deputy-Secretary-General: Ishaan Vijai</h4>
    
It is with great pride and honour that I welcome each and every one of you to WarMUN 2021! I'm a first-year Mathematics and Philosophy student from India with a deep interest in politics and justice systems. Knowing what WarMUN has in store this fall, I can assure you that at the end of these two days, each one of you will be enriched with a newfound interest in international affairs and political discourse. You will have the coveted opportunity of meeting and interacting with similarly focused individuals that share the same goal: use WarMUN as a forum for discussions and debates for the benefit of tomorrow, while also exploring your own interests. WarMUN is truly one of a kind, and I hope to see you there!

    <h4>Under-Secretary-General for Chairing: Ankit Mehta</h4>
    
Greetings all, it is a pleasure to welcome you to WarMUN 2021 as the Under-Secretary-General of Chairing. I have always been interested in the relationships between the social, political, and finance spheres- I carry this fascination with me as an Accounting and Finance undergraduate at Warwick. In 2020, I was honoured to meet Ban Ki-moon, the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations. Upon asking him the determining traits of delegate success, he informed me that confidence, critical thinking, and candour are amongst the most appreciated qualities in a diplomat. Therefore, I am excited to observe passionate debate and the formulation of astute resolutions during the committee sessions. We wish you the best of luck, let’s make the most of it!

    <h4>Under-Secretaries-General for Logistics: Jasmine Nasser, Keeley Ruane</h4>
    
Hi everyone, I am excited to welcome you all to this year's Warwick Model United Nations conference! My name is Jasmine Nasser and I will be serving as one half of the Under Secretary General of Logistics. As a third year Politics and International Studies student, MUN has been a large part of my university and school life. Therefore, I am exhilarated to be a part of the 2021 WARMUN team! MUN conferences are an amazing experience, many of which  embed long-lasting friendships as you get to meet so many different people. So, after a long period of time, being able to host another conference is exciting. We ensure that WARMUN 2021 will be beyond everyone’s expectations! I cannot wait to see you all soon.

Despite being new to the society myself, allow me to welcome you to the Warwick Model  United Nations 2021. My name is Keeley Ruane, I’m a third year English Literature student who next year will be completing an LLM in International Law and Human Rights, though some may argue (mostly Adrian) that, most importantly, I will be one half of the Under Secretary General of Logistics for the 2021 MUN here at the University of Warwick! Over the past three years, I’ve increasingly directed my academic career in line with developments from the United Nations’ OHCHR, of which such passion has been further facilitated by Warwick UN Society and Warwick’s Centre for Human Rights in Practice. Having worked for LIMUN last year and organised Cambridge International IQ Schools sixth-form MUN conferences before, I’m beyond eager to bring you the conference that not only meets your expectations but dramatically exceeds them. I can’t wait to learn something from each and every one of you!

    <b> P.S. Yes - WarMUN trumps all. Adrian </b>
