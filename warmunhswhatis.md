WARMUN High School is a Model United Nations conference specifically crafted for Six Form Students. The conference will take place between the 7th to 8th of March 2020 at the University of Warwick.  

In our 2 day event,  your students will have the opportunity to represent a United Nations' Member State in a simulation of a Committee whose topics will range from politics, economics, global security and human rights. They will have to debate on these issues of pivotal importance, thus improving their argumentative and public speaking skills and will then have to come up with a Resolution to address the issue. This will ensure honing of their negotiation ability.  

Model UN is truly an invaluable asset for university applications as it is valued highly by Universities all across the country; your students will stand out from the crowd by showing they are on their way to being responsible citizens of this world and balanced individuals.
