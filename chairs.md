description: Information for chairs

This section is for those experienced MUN delegates who are preparing to chair at an MUN club or conference in the skills they need to chair debates effectively. It includes the ReiMUN chair training manual. It gives guidance on all the aspects of MUN  that you will need, including worked examples. Please read the *whole* document carefully, more than once if necessary.

However, while knowledge of procedure and protocol is of course very important, when you are chairing you should keep three points uppermost in your mind, and then you shouldn’t go too far wrong.

* **Fairness** Ensure that each delegate gets an equal opportunity to speak. Ensure that all delegates’ opinions are shown the proper respect. Be sympathetic to younger and more inexperienced delegates and help them if they are hesitant or make mistakes. While the chair should never be seen to favour a particular person or point of view, you may need to help a delegate if they are struggling to defend a minority opinion.

* **Common Sense** Remember that the point of the conference is to encourage good quality debate. Use your discretion to facilitate this, which may sometimes involve overlooking small mistakes. Exercise your judgement on decisions. If you think something is out of order, then it probably is. If you think it isn’t, it probably isn’t.

* **Confidence** You are in charge. If you have made a decision, then be confident in it. Sometimes you may need to explain your decision to the floor, but this is only so that they understand the decision, not so that they can question or challenge it. Don’t be hesitant or timid or unsure. Even if you are not certain of the correct protocol, if you have followed the principles of fairness and common sense then your decision will almost certainly be a good one.

You will nearly always be chairing in teams of two or three. In this case, one chair should be listening to the debate in order to keep it flowing, take points of information, and make a judgement on points of order. The other chair(s) will be dealing with any notes that come to the chair, monitoring timing in order to ask delegates to draw their remarks to a close if they go on too long, and dealing with any other issues that might otherwise distract the attention of the lead chair. You should rotate the roles of the different chairs through the day so that all members of the team have the opportunity to act as lead chair for some of the debate.

Finally, remember that chairing is *the* most important responsibility at an MUN conference: without chairs, debate would end in chaos. Despite being such an important role, it is also hugely enjoyable, so also make sure you have fun while doing it.
