## Lobbying

More experienced delegates will often bring resolutions to conference to get them debated.  (For more information on this, see Writing a Resolution.)  Even if you do not have a resolution, lobbying time is still imortant to find out about other people’s resolutions that they hope to submit.

After you have written your resolution, you need to try to get it debated.  Many other people will have resolutions too, and there won’t be time to debate them all.  How do you make sure yours gets debated?  That’s what lobbying is for.

If you have written a resolution, you are called the submitter.  However, before it can be debated, you need to show that other people support it as well.  The more people support the resolution, the more likely it is to be debated.

During the lobbying process, you show your resolution to other delegates and encourage them to support it.  If they agree, they add their name to the resolution as a co-submitter.  You may also choose to co-submit other people’s resolutions that you think are good.  Please note the following points:

* Most conferences only allow you to co-submit one resolution, so choose carefully.

* You need at least three co-submitters for your resolution to be debated.  (If you have more than three, that is even better!)

* If you co-submit a resolution, that means you agree to vote for it.

* Once you have all your co-submitters, you need to submit your resolution to the chairs.

## Debating

Once the resolutions have been submitted, the chairs will choose a resolution to debate.  They will photocopy the resolution so all delegates can see it.
The chair will invite the submitter to take the floor (ie. come up to the front to speak).  The submitter will read the operative clauses of the resolution (the bits of the resolution that say what the United Nations should do).  They will then have some time to explain why it is a good resolution and why other countries should support it.

When the speaker has finished speaking, it is normal to invite points of information (questions about what they have said).  The chair will then say, “The speaker has opened themself to points of information.  Are there any points from the floor?  Please raise your placards.”  If you want to ask a question, you should raise your placard (the sign that says which country you are representing), which you will be given at the start of the conference.

If you are asking a question, please note the following points:

* This takes a bit of getting used to, but you should ask your question to the chair and ask about the speech that was made, rather than asking the person you spoke.  So instead of saying, “Do you think that…?”  You should say, “Does the delegate of Syria think that…?”

* Make sure that you ask a question, and make sure the question is about what has just been said.  If you want to make a statement of your own about the resolution, you should wait until the speaker has sat down and ask to take the floor.

* You should stand up in your place to ask your question, and you should remain standing until they have answered it.

* If you want to ask a second question, or if you feel they haven’t answered your question, you must ask the chair for a right of reply.  To do this, say, “Right of reply?”  If the chair agrees, then you may ask another question.
After the points of information are finished, the speaker will sit down.  The chair will then invite another speaker to take the floor.  If you wish to speak, you should raise your placard.

When you are speaking, please note the following points:

* You must refer to your country, not to yourself.  So you should not say “I think that…” but “Sweden believes that…”

* Try to make sure that your comments are about the resolution specifically, and not just about the general issue.  You might wish to support or oppose the resolution as a whole, or you might want to comment on just one bit of the resolution (the different bits are called clauses).

* Remember that you are trying to persuade other delegates to agree with you.

* When you finish speaking, you may say one of three things:

     * “I open myself to points of information.”  (This is normal, and means other delegates can ask you questions about what you have just said.)

     * “I yield the floor to the chair.”  (This means that you don’t want to take any questions, and the chair will choose another delegate to speak.)

     * “I yield the floor to [another country]” (This means that you choose the next person to speak.  This is rare, but if you know that another person agrees with you then you might want to do this.  It is most common for the person first submitting their resolution to yield to one of their co-submitters.”

## Amendments

Sometimes you may find that you agree with most of a resolution being debated, but there are a few bits that you want to change in order to make it better.  If you wish to do this, you should send a note to the chair explaining how you want to amend the resolution.  This will be in one of three ways.

a) “Strike Clause 3” – this means that you want to remove Clause 3 from the resolution, but leave all the other clauses alone.

b) “Add new Clause 6:  …” – this means you want to keep all the clauses in the resolution, but you want to add something extra as well.

c) “Amend Clause 2 to read: ….” – this means that you want to change the wording of Clause 2, which may include adding words, removing words, or changing the way it is expressed.

If the chair agrees to let your amendment be debated, you will be invited to take the floor to explain why the resolution is better if it is changed.  Other speakers may oppose the change.  After discussion about the amendment, it will be put to a vote.  If the amendment passes, debate on the modified resolution will continue.  If the amendment fails, debate will continue on the original resolution.

If someone suggests amending your resolution and you agree with their amendment, you can shorten the debate by making a friendly amendment.  This means that when the amendment is read out, you say to the chair, “Motion to make this a friendly amendment.”  If the chair agrees, then the resolution will be changed without needing any more debate.

## Note-passing

It is sometimes useful to pass notes to the chair or to other delegates during the debate.  This is why you should bring some headed notepaper to the conference.  The main things you may need to pass notes about are about amendments.  This will obviously include telling the chair what your amendment is.  However, you may want to get support for your amendment before you submit it, so you may wish to write to other delegates to see what they think about your amendment.  You could write to the person who wrote the resolution to ask if they would support a friendly amendment.  You may wish to ask another delegate if you can yield the floor to them once you have proposed the amendment, or if they would yield the floor to you after they have spoken.

## Voting

At the end of the debate, the resolution will be voted on.  You may vote one of three ways:

* For (this means you agree with the resolution and want it to pass)

* Against (this means you disagree with the resolution and want it to fail)

* Abstain (this means you have no view on the resolution and choose not to vote)
For voting on amendments, you may only vote for or against and may not abstain.

#### Other points

As well as points of information, there are a number of other points that it is useful to be aware of, which are used less frequently.  Until you become quite experienced, you are only ever likely to need the first two.

* A Point of Personal Privilege refers to the well-being of a delegate.  It may not refer to the resolution.  It may only interrupt a speaker if the speech is inaudible.  This is the only point that may interrupt a speaker.

* A Point of Order is a question about procedure, or if the speaker says something offensive.  It has to be addressed to the Chair.  It can be made during a pause in a speech.  To make a point of order, you say, “Point of Order” when the speaker pauses or finishes.  When the chair invites you to make your point, you should stand and ask the chair, “Is it in order for…?”

* A Point of Parliamentary Enquiry is a question to the Chair about the rules of procedure.

* Orders of the Day is a call to return to the main topic of the debate, if you think the debate has gone off topic.

* Permission to Approach the Chair is a request to discuss a problem with the Chair privately.

* Explain Vote is a request, after a vote, by a delegate to explain the way he or she voted.  Usually one for each FOR, AGAINST and ABSTAINED would be given half a minute.

* Move to Extend Debate Time is a request to have further time FOR and AGAINST a resolution.  It should have a seconder.  If anyone objects, it is put to a vote (without debate), a simple majority being required.

* Move to Table is used to propose a stop to consideration of a resolution if that resolution clearly has little support and would be a waste of time to debate fully.  It should have a seconder.  If anyone objects, it is put to a vote (without debate), a simple majority being required.

* Move the Previous Question is a call to end debate time and to vote on the resolution.  It should have a seconder.  If anyone objects, it is put to a vote (without debate), a two-thirds majority being required.

* Move to adjourn is a proposal to finish proceedings.  It should have a seconder.  If anyone objects, it is put to a vote (without debate) a simple majority being required.

* Refer the Question is a proposal to send a resolution to be considered by another committee.  It should have a seconder.  If anyone objects it is debated (3 minutes FOR and 3 minutes AGAINST) and is then put to a vote, a simple majority being required.

## Awards

At the end of the day, most conferences give awards to the best delegates.  The criteria for giving awards may vary from conference to conference, but will normally include some or all of the following:

* How accurately you represent the views of your country

* How well you construct resolutions

* Correct use of proper debating style and language

* The level of respect you show to the chairs and other delegates
