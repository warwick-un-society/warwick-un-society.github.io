## What is Model United Nations?

A Model United Nations (MUN) conference is an event in which students play the role of diplomats representing particular countries at the United Nations.  MUN is run by students for students and this gives it a unique and exciting atmosphere.  Those who participate fully have tremendous fun.

## The Purpose of the UN

The purpose of the United Nations is for the countries of the world to work together to find answers to some of the world's major issues.  The United Nations was set up after the Second World War to try to prevent war and the causes of war in the future.  The United Nations also promotes human rights and development around the world.  The purpose of the United Nations cannot be made plainer than as it is set out in the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations.

> We the Peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,
>
> And for these ends to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, and to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest, and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples, have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish these aims.
>
> Accordingly, our respective Governments, through representatives assembled in the city of San Francisco, who have exhibited their full powers found to be in good and due form, have agreed to the present Charter of the United Nations and do hereby establish an international organization to be known as the United Nations.

## The Structure of an MUN conference

An MUN conference will have a number of countries represented.  Each country will be represented by a number of students (usually between three and six, depending on the conference).  The students will represent their country's position (and *not* their own) in different committees, so that each country will have one representative per committee.  (Teams are called ‘delegations’, and individual team members are called ‘delegates’.)

Different conferences will have different committees, but some of the more common are these:

* Political (discussing issues about government, territorial disputes, etc)

* Human Rights (discussing issues of injustice or discrimination, such as sexism, racism, child labour, political prisoners, etc)

* Economic & Social (discussing financial, cultural and social issues facing the world, such as trade, regulation, etc)

* Ecology & Environment (concerned with issues such as global warming, pollution, etc)

* Peace-Keeping and International Security, PKIS (discussing issues where conflict has arisen in the world)

* Development (discussing how to increase levels of human and economic development in the world)

* Disarmament (discussing how to reduce the amount of weapons in the world)

* Health (considering how to improve the health of the world’s citizens)

Many conferences, especially the larger ones, will also have a Security Council.  This is a smaller committee, consisting only of 15 countries (normally those that are the current members of the real Security Council), which makes decisions on serious and urgent issues in the world, especially around war and military action.  Security Council delegates are usually more experienced, and debates in the SC take a different format from other committees.

Most conferences also have a General Assembly.  In GA, all the delegates from every committee congregate in a large hall.  One or more of the resolutions that has been passed in committee will be debated more fully in GA.  Many conferences also include an emergency debate in GA: a debate on a developing (fictional) world crisis, so that delegates have the opportunity to think on their feet and respond to an issue for which they have not prepared.
