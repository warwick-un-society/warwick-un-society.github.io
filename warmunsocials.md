Delegates attending WarMUN can look forward towards a fun set of socials: a night of fun clubbing, where they can meet and interact with the members of their committee after a hard day of debate, and a classy Ball, to allow delegates to show off their best outfits. Our fun weekend of socials are sure to bring another level of fun an enjoyment to our conference.

Our first night will be a disco night in Neon, in nearby Leamington Spa. Note that under-18s will not be admitted.

Our second night will be a formal ball at the Chesford Grange Hotel, also located in Leamington Spa. Delegates can look forward to a two-course meal and entertainment! Delegates of all ages are welcome to join us at the ball!

Our social pack registration deadline ends on the 10th of November, or when we reach capacity, so please hurry if you're interested!

To participate in our social events, be sure to purchase our Social Pack when you sign up for the conference!
