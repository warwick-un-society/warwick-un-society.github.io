## <a name="goodchairing"></a>Good chairing

A good chair should have a firm grasp of how MUN works and, in particular:

* Have an excellent understanding of the debating rules.

* Have a good understanding of how a resolution is written so that they can advise a delegate.

* Have a rough idea of the position of various countries.

* Have an understanding of the issues to be debated.

> Please read and be familiar with the Delegate Handbook, the ReiMUN Conference Guide and the Chair Handbook, and also research the topics on your committee.

During the debate a good Chair will:

* Ensure a fair opportunity for every delegate to speak and encourage less experienced delegates to take part.

* Be aware of what is going on at all times (not be distracted by notes etc).

* Keep the debate flowing.

* Control the debate without being over-authoritarian, using good humour when possible, but always being prepared to explain what is happening to the less experienced delegate.

* Keep an accurate record of what has taken place during the debate.

## <a name="inpractice"></a>Chairing in Practice

There is no set formula that a Chair can use, as each debate will depend on the topic and the resolution, but most of all on the personalities of the delegates taking part. In the same way that a referee has to respond to an unfolding situation, the Chair needs to enforce the rules fairly, stay on top of events, but let the “game” flow. Chairing involves applying the rules of the debate and the principles of the United Nations, having a clear idea about what is to be accomplished and to using common sense. Certain behaviour is completely out of order (one delegate insulting another, insulting another country, showing lack of respect towards other delegates or the Chair). Sometimes an inexperienced delegate will say things that are not really in order; in this case explain the situation sympathetically. Sometimes experienced delegates get carried away or indulge in unreasonable behaviour.

There may be grey areas and this is where knowledge, experience and common sense come in to play. The key question to ask yourself is — is the delegate being diplomatic?

Delegates are entitled to express their own opinion or the position of their country, but this must be done carefully and diplomatically. It must not be insulting to other delegates or against the principles of the United Nations or against the country’s own policy.

For example an Israeli delegate stating “in the interests of the security of our state it is necessary to exert strong control over certain groups that are attempting to bring down our government” would be in order. However, if it was delivered as “we believe in killing Palestinians,” it would not be acceptable and the Chair should rule the delegate out of order.

Responses by the Chair in such cases might be that “Such attitudes are completely against the principles of the UN of which Iraq is a member.” Another ruling could be that “Israel has ratified the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and the therefore the delegate is at variance with the stated policy of their country.”

Sanctions that the Chair may impose would be to ask the delegate to apologise to another delegate, or apologise to the committee. For clear and deliberate breaches of diplomatic behaviour such as advocating killing, use of torture, declaring war, the Chair should intervene before any other delegate objects and usual decision would be to order the delegate to yield the floor and sit down.

Remember that delegates are instructed that it is their duty to:

> *1. respect the decision of the Chair at all times;*
>
> *2. obtain the floor before speaking;*
>
> *3. stand when speaking;*
>
> *4. yield the floor when required to do so by the Chair;*
>
> *5. be courteous at all times;*
>
> *6. avoid the use of insulting or abusive language.*

A Chair should be seen to be fair, to be reasonable, to know as much as the best delegate and to be in control. It is possible for the Chair to decide not to follow usual procedure, but this should be justified, not just imposed. Useful phrases might be

* “In the interests of balanced debate…”

* or “In view of the time available…” followed by

  * “…the Chair will not take points at this time”,

  * “…the Chair has decided that all points are out of order at this time”

* or “…the Chair will not entertain…”.

Sometimes delegates with moderate experience try to show off by using parliamentary motions.

You could permit the motion, but many of the delegates at ReiMUN will not understand what it is all about. If you decide to grant it, you will need to explain the outcome and each stage of the procedure. Perhaps the best way to tackle this at ReiMUN is to refuse to grant it.

For example:

> A delegate asks to “Move the previous Question”. If you don’t feel this is appropriate, your response could be, “The delegate has asked to move the previous question. This means finishing the debate and voting on the resolution. To implement this motion requires a seconder and then if anyone objects a two thirds majority vote. However, the Chair feels that in respect for the delegate who has done lots of work on the resolution, it should be debated fully.”
>
> Alternatively, you could wait a few seconds after the move has been called for and say, “The motion has not been seconded, so it cannot be entertained.”

## <a name="importantdetails"></a>Important Details for the Chair to Remember

### Points

Delegates should not raise placards until the Chair asks “Are there any points on the floor” — NOT when the speaker announces that they are yielding to points. Points of Order take precedence over other points and must be answered by the Chair. No point, except one of Personal Privilege, may interrupt a speaker, but it is acceptable to make a point of order during a pause in a speech.

### Amendments

In open debate amendments can be proposed at any time as long as the Chair has recognised the speaker. In closed debate amendments should be in time against unless it is a friendly amendment (accepted by the writer of the resolution) in which case it is automatically passed without debate.

If an amendment passes, the floor reverts to the Chair. If it fails, it returns to the speaker on the main resolution.

Amendments to amendments (amendments to the second degree) are possible. Amendments to the third degree and so forth are also possible, but ideally you should avoid them for the sake of good debate. Instead aim to submit an amendment to the first degree at a later time. If an amendment to the second (or higher) degree passes, all related amendments to a lower degree automatically pass as well.

### Voting

Voting on a resolution will be *for*, *against* or *abstain*.

In the event of a tie, the resolution passes.

If the resolution fails, but would have passed if all those abstaining had voted for it, a “Division of the House” is in order. In a Division of the House delegates must vote *for* or *against*. If the votes do not add up to the previous total, then individual votes must be recorded delegate by delegate.

For example:

> | For | Against | Abstain | Division of the House? |
> | --- | ------- | ------- | ---------------------  |
> | 24  | 34      | 6       | No: 24 + 6 ≠ 34        |
> | 28  | 32      | 10      | Yes: 28 + 10 = 38 (it could pass) |
> | 31  | 29      | 10      | No: the resolution has passed |

Voting on amendments must be *for* or *against* (ie. no abstentions).

If an amendment to the second (or higher) degree is passed, the parent amendment also passes. If an amendment to the second (or higher) degree fails, the parent amendment must be voted on separately.

## <a name="procedure"></a>Debate Procedure

### An Open Debate

Start by saying

> “Will the floor come to order”

Then announce the topic of the debate and the submitter of the resolution.

> “Today’s debate is on [global warming] and the resolution has been submitted by [Germany]”

Ask the submitter to read the operative clauses

> “[Germany] please read the operative clauses.”

After the operative clauses have been read say

> “Thank you [Germany]. We shall have twenty minutes of open debate. [Germany], you have the floor for twenty minutes”

After the first speaker has been speaking for about two minutes ask the speaker to yield to points.

> “[Germany], in the interests of debate, please yield to points.”

The speaker has yielded to points.

> “Are there any points on the floor?”
>
> “[Italy], you have been recognised. Please rise and make your point”

Remember that a point must be phrased as a question. Try to keep points brief. Remember that a point of order must be heard before anything else. A point of order is addressed to the Chair and you should respond to it.

Remember that the time taken to ask a question is not timed, but the time for the speaker to answer it is part of the speaker’s time on the floor.

Allow two or three points and then ask the speaker to yield the floor. The speaker may yield to the Chair (in which case you choose the next speaker) or may yield to another delegate.

> “[Germany], in the interests of debate, please yield the floor.”
>
> “I yield the floor to [Nigeria]”
>
> “Thank you [Germany]. [Nigeria], you have been recognised. You have the floor for thirteen minutes”

Again allow the speaker about two minutes of debate time. Encourage as many delegates as possible to speak. ReiMUN Conference Rules state that only two consecutive yields to other delegations are permissible.

When the end of the debate is reached, say

> “Debate time has now elapsed. We shall move directly into voting procedures”

A Closed debate would be similar except that all those speaking in time *for* must be in favour of the resolution, although points of information may be for or against. Those speaking in time against must be speaking against the resolution, but points may be for or against. Amendments to the resolution should be in time against (unless they are ‘friendly’ amendments — see above).

### The Tally Sheet

In order to keep a record of the contributions each delegate has made, please use a tally sheet. These will have a list of country names and a space to record points or speeches made. Give a score of 1 for a Point of Information or Point of Order. Give a score out of 5 for a speech. The speech should be reasonable to score 5 — it does not have to be brilliant.

￼A rough guide to the score would be:

|                                                |         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Spoke relevantly on the topic for 1—2 minutes  | Score 2 |
| Reasonably well informed                       | Score 1 |
| Reasonable speaking skills (audible & clear)   | Score 1 |
| Answered questions reasonably well             | Score 1 |

Most speeches would score 5. If a speech is particularly good, perhaps note it with a \*.
