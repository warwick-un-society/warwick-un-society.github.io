    </p>
  <p align="left"><u>What is Model United Nations?</u><br>
    A Model United Nations (MUN) conference is an event in which students play the  role of diplomats representing particular countries at the United  Nations.&nbsp; An MUN is run by students for students and this gives it a  unique and exciting atmosphere.&nbsp; Those who participate fully have  tremendous fun.</p>
  <p align="right"><a href="#Contents">Return to top</a><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><u><a name="Purpose"></a>The Purpose of the UN</u><br>
    The purpose of the United Nations is for the countries of the world to work  together to find answers to some of the big problems in the world.&nbsp; The  United Nations was set up after the Second World War to try to prevent war and  the causes of war in the future.&nbsp; The United Nations also promote human  rights and development around the world.&nbsp; The purpose of the United  Nations is set out in the Preamble of the UN Charter.&nbsp; This is given  below.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left"><em>We the Peoples of the United  Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to  reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the  human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and  small, and to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the  obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be  maintained, and to promote social progress and better standards of life in  larger freedom,</em> <br>
    <em>And for these ends to  practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good  neighbours, and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and  security, and to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of  methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest, and  to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social  advancement of all peoples, have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish  these aims.</em> <br>
    <em>Accordingly, our respective  Governments, through representatives assembled in the city of San Francisco,  who have exhibited their full powers found to be in good and due form, have  agreed to the present Charter of the United Nations and do hereby establish an  international organization to be known as the United Nations.</em> </p>
  <p align="right"><a href="#Contents">Return to top</a><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><u><a name="Structure"></a>The Structure of an MUN  conference</u><br>
    An MUN conference will have a number of countries represented.&nbsp; Each  country will be represented by a number of students (usually between three and  six, depending on the conference).&nbsp; The students will represent their  country in different committees, so that each country will have one  representative per committee.&nbsp; (Teams are called ‘delegations’, and  individual team members are called ‘delegates’.)<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Different conferences will have  different committess, but some of the more common are these:<br>
    - Political (discussing issues about government, territorial disputes, etc)<br>
    - Human Rights (discussing issues of injustice or discrimination, such as  sexism, racism, child labour, political prisoners, etc)<br>
    - Economic &amp; Social (discussing financial, cultural and social issues  facing the world, such as trade, regulation, etc)<br>
    - Ecology &amp; Environment (concerned with issues such as global warming,  pollution, etc)<br>
    - Peace-Keeping and International Security, <em>PKIS</em> (discussing issues  where conflict has arisen in the world)<br>
    - Disarmament (discussing how to reduce the amount of weapons in the world)<br>
    - Health (considering how to improve the health of the world’s citizens)<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Many conferences, especially the  larger ones, will also have a Security Council.&nbsp; This is a smaller  committee, consisting only of 15 countries, which makes decisions on serious  and urgent issues in the world, especially around war and military  action.&nbsp; Security Council delegates are usually more experienced, and  debates in the SC take a different format from other committees.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Most conferences also have a  General Assembly.&nbsp; In GA, all the delegates from every committee  congregate in a large hall.&nbsp; One or more of the resolutions that has been  passed in committee will be debated more fully in GA.&nbsp; Many conferences  also include an emergency debate in GA: a debate on a developing (fictional)  world crisis, so that delegates have the opportunity to think on their feet and  respond to an issue for which they have not prepared.<br>
    </p><p align="right"><a href="#Contents">Return to top</a><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><strong><a name="Issues"></a>Preparing for a Conference</strong> <br>
    </p>
  <p align="left"><u>Researching the Issues</u><br>
    Once you have applied for a conference, you will be allocated a country.&nbsp;  You will normally be part of a team (‘delegation’), with each team member  (‘delegate’) representing the country on a different committee.<br>
    You will need to start with a  team meeting to decide which member of the team (or delegate) will take part in  which particular committee.&nbsp; Each committee will have an agenda and the  first stage is to research the issues on the agenda.&nbsp; The agenda for this  conference is printed on page 4.<br>
    </p><p align="right"><a href="#Contents">Return to top</a><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><u><a name="Country"></a>Researching your Country</u><br>
    The next stage is to find out about the country the team (or delegation) is  representing.&nbsp; Gather information on the type of government, economy,  geography, history, language(s) and culture.&nbsp; You may find it useful to  look up the website of the country’s Embassy or High Commission.&nbsp; <br>
    Information can also be found on <br>
    <a href="http://www.theodora.com/wfb/abc_world_fact_book.html">www.theodora.com/wfb/abc_world_fact_book.html</a> and on <a href="http://www.un.org/">www.un.org</a>, looking in - Member states – Home Pages of  Permanent Missions.<br>
    Now put the first two stages  together and work out your country’s policy on each item on the agenda.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="right"><a href="#Contents">Return to top</a><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><u><a name="PolicyStatement"></a>Policy Statement</u> <br>
    Having established what the policy of your country is on an issue, you should  then convert this to a policy statement.&nbsp; Each delegate will need to  prepare a policy statement of about 45 seconds on Topic 1 for their committee,  which you will need to read out.&nbsp; It will also be useful to have a policy  statement on Topic 2 as well, although you will not need to read this out,  because it will help you to decide what to say and which resolutions to  support.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left">A policy statement should contain  the following:</p>
  <div align="left">
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>An outline of the particular issue</li>
      <li>A statement of the country’s position on the       issue</li>
      <li>Suggestions for a solution to the problem</li>
    </ul>
  </div><p align="right"><a href="#Contents">Return to top</a><br>
  </p>
<p align="left">Below are some example  policy statements, so that you can get an idea of the kind of thing you might  want to say.<br>
      </p>
  <p align="left"><u><a name="ExPS"></a>Example Policy Statements</u> <br>
      </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Country:  Sweden&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Topic:&nbsp; Provision of primary education</strong> <br>
    </p>
  <p align="left">Sweden believes strongly in  education for all.&nbsp; Education is essential for citizens to develop the  skills needed to be productive in adult life.&nbsp; Sweden has compulsory  education for all children aged 7 to 16.&nbsp; We believe that this has helped  our country to become prosperous.&nbsp; <br>
    Sweden believes that all  countries should make the provision of free primary education for all children  a priority.&nbsp; Some countries struggle to provide free education, and Sweden  believes that the richer countries in the world should be willing to provide  financial support in order to enable this to happen.&nbsp; Countries with more  educated people are more prosperous and able to trade more, so it is in the  interests of richer countries to help poorer countries educate their citizens,  so that they can trade with them.&nbsp; Education is also the best way to  prevent human rights abuses, to prevent the exploitation of children, and to  promote the well-being of women and girls throughout the world.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Country: Saudi  Arabia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Topic:&nbsp; Exploitation of women</strong> <br>
    </p>
  <p align="left">Saudi Arabia is an Islamic  kingdom and follows the teachings of the Qur’an and the principles of Sharia  law.&nbsp; Islam teaches the protection of women by their male relatives, to  safeguard them against being exploited.<br>
    Saudi Arabia rejects the Western  idea that women and men are the same.&nbsp; It is because we understand that  men and women have different roles and obligations in life that we protect our  women from having to fend for themselves in a man’s world.&nbsp; Saudi Arabia  condemns the exploitation of women practised in Western countries, which  encourage women to excite men’s sexual desires.&nbsp; Saudi Arabia calls for  the honour and dignity of women to be preserved and defended in all countries.<p align="right"><a href="#Contents">Return to top</a><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><u><a name="Dress"></a>Dress </u><br>
    Dress for the conference is formal.&nbsp; Gentlemen should wear suits with  collar and tie, and ladies should also be formally dressed.&nbsp; Delegates who  are incorrectly dressed will not be allowed into the General Assembly.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="right"><a href="#Contents">Return to top</a><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><u><a name="Notepaper"></a>Headed notepaper</u><br>
    You should bring with you some note-paper with your country name on the top,  which you can use to send notes during the conference (see ‘Note-passing’  below).<br>
    </p>
  <p align="right"><a href="#Contents">Return to top</a><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>At the Conference&nbsp; </strong> <br>
    </p>
  <p align="left"><u><a name="Lobbying"></a>Lobbying</u> <br>
    More experienced delegates will often bring resolutions to conference to get  them debated.&nbsp; (For more information on this, see <a href="resolutions/index.html" target="_blank">Writing a Resolution</a>.)&nbsp; Even if you do not have a  resolution, lobbying time is still imortant to find out about other people’s  resolutions that they hope to submit.<br>
    After you have written your  resolution, you need to try to get it debated.&nbsp; Many other people will  have resolutions too, and there won’t be time to debate them all.&nbsp; How do  you make sure yours gets debated?&nbsp; That’s what lobbying is for.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left">If you have written a resolution,  you are called the <strong>submitter</strong>.&nbsp; However, before it can be  debated, you need to show that other people support it as well.&nbsp; The more  people support the resolution, the more likely it is to be debated.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left">During the lobbying process, you  show your resolution to other delegates and encourage them to support it.&nbsp;  If they agree, they add their name to the resolution as a <strong>co-submitter</strong>.&nbsp;  You may also choose to co-submit other people’s resolutions that you think are  good.&nbsp; Please note the following points:<br>
    - Most conferences only allow you to co-submit <u>one</u> resolution, so choose  carefully.<br>
    - You need at least three co-submitters for your resolution to be  debated.&nbsp; (If you have more than three, that is even better!)<br>
    - If you co-submit a resolution, that means you agree to vote for it.<br>
    - Once you have all your co-submitters, you need to submit your resolution to  the chairs.<br>
    </p><p align="right"><a href="#Contents">Return to top</a><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><u><a name="Debating"></a>Debating</u> <br>
    Once the resolutions have been submitted, the chairs will choose a resolution  to debate.&nbsp; They will photocopy the resolution so all delegates can see  it.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left">The chair will invite the  submitter to <strong>take the floor</strong> (ie. come up to the front to  speak).&nbsp; The submitter will read the <strong>operative clauses</strong> of  the resolution (the bits of the resolution that say what the United Nations  should do).&nbsp; They will then have some time to explain why it is a good  resolution and why other countries should support it.<br>
    When the speaker has finished  speaking, it is normal to invite <strong>points of information</strong> (questions about what they have said).&nbsp; The chair will then say, “The  speaker has opened him/herself to points of information.&nbsp; Are there any  points from the floor?&nbsp; Please raise your placards.”&nbsp; If you want to  ask a question, you should raise your <strong>placard</strong> (the sign that  says which country you are representing), which you will be given at the start  of the conference.<br>
    If you are asking a question,  please note the following points:<br>
    - This takes a bit of getting used to, but you should ask your question <u>to  the chair</u> and ask <u>about</u> the speech that was made, rather than asking  the person you spoke.&nbsp; So instead of saying, “Do you think that…?”&nbsp;  You should say, “Does the delegate of Syria think that…?”<br>
    - Make sure that you ask a <u>question</u>, and make sure the question is about  what has just been said.&nbsp; If you want to make a statement of your own  about the resolution, you should wait until the speaker has sat down and ask to  take the floor.<br>
    - You should stand up in your place to ask your question, and you should remain  standing until they have answered it.<br>
    - If you want to ask a second question, or if you feel they haven’t answered  your question, you must ask the chair for a <strong>right of reply</strong>.&nbsp;  To do this, say, “Right of reply?”&nbsp; If the chair agrees, then you may ask  another question.<br>
    After the points of information  are finished, the speaker will sit down.&nbsp; The chair will then invite  another speaker to take the floor.&nbsp; If you wish to speak, you should raise  your placard.<br>
    When you are speaking, please  note the following points:<br>
    - You must refer to your country, not to yourself.&nbsp; So you should not say  “I think that…” but “Sweden believes that…”<br>
    - Try to make sure that your comments are about the resolution specifically,  and not just about the general issue.&nbsp; You might wish to support or oppose  the resolution as a whole, or you might want to comment on just one bit of the  resolution (the different bits are called <strong>clauses</strong>).<br>
    - Remember that you are trying to persuade other delegates to agree with you.<br>
    - When you finish speaking, you may say one of three things:<br>
    <em>“I open myself to points of information.”</em>&nbsp; (This is normal, and  means other delegates can ask you questions about what you have just said.)<br>
    <em>“I yield the floor to the chair.”</em>&nbsp; (This means that you don’t  want to take any questions, and the chair will choose another delegate to  speak.)<br>
    <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I yield the floor to [another country]”</em> (This means that you choose the next person to speak.&nbsp; This is rare, but  if you know that another person agrees with you then you might want to do this.&nbsp;  It is most common for the person first submitting their resolution to yield to  one of their co-submitters.”<br>
    </p><p align="right"><a href="#Contents">Return to top</a><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><u><a name="Amendments"></a>Amendments</u> <br>
    Sometimes you may find that you agree with most of a resolution being debated,  but there are a few bits that you want to change in order to make it  better.&nbsp; If you wish to do this, you should send a note to the chair  explaining how you want to amend the resolution.&nbsp; This will be in one of  three ways.<br>
    a) “Strike Clause 3” – this means that you want to remove Clause 3 from the  resolution, but leave all the other clauses alone.<br>
    b) “Add new Clause 6:&nbsp; …” – this means you want to keep all the clauses in  the resolution, but you want to add something extra as well.<br>
    c) “Amend Clause 2 to read: ….” – this means that you want to change the  wording of Clause 2, which may include adding words, removing words, or  changing the way it is expressed.<br>
    If the chair agrees to let your  amendment be debated, you will be invited to take the floor to explain why the  resolution is better if it is changed.&nbsp; Other speakers may oppose the  change.&nbsp; After discussion about the amendment, it will be put to a  vote.&nbsp; If the amendment passes, debate on the modified resolution will  continue.&nbsp; If the amendment fails, debate will continue on the original  resolution.<br>
    If someone suggests amending your  resolution and you agree with their amendment, you can shorten the debate by  making a <strong>friendly amendment</strong>.&nbsp; This means that when the  amendment is read out, you say to the chair, “Motion to make this a friendly  amendment.”&nbsp; If the chair agrees, then the resolution will be changed  without needing any more debate.<br>

    It is sometimes useful to pass notes to the chair or to other delegates during  the debate.&nbsp; This is why you should bring some headed notepaper to the  conference.&nbsp; The main things you may need to pass notes about are about  amendments.&nbsp; This will obviously include telling the chair what your  amendment is.&nbsp; However, you may want to get support for your amendment  before you submit it, so you may wish to write to other delegates to see what  they think about your amendment.&nbsp; You could write to the person who wrote  the resolution to ask if they would support a friendly amendment.&nbsp; You may  wish to ask another delegate if you can yield the floor to them once you have  proposed the amendment, or if they would yield the floor to you after they have  spoken.<br>

  <p align="left"><u><a name="Voting"></a>Voting</u> <br>
    At the end of the debate, the resolution will be voted on.&nbsp; You may vote  one of three ways:</p>
  <div align="left">
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>For (this means you agree with the resolution       and want it to pass)</li>
      <li>Against (this means you disagree with the       resolution and want it to fail)</li>
      <li>Abstain (this means you have no view on the       resolution and choose not to vote)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p align="left">For voting on amendments, you may  only vote for or against and may not abstain.<br>

  <p align="left"><u><a name="Points"></a>Other points</u><br>
    As well as points of information, there are a number of other points that it is  useful to be aware of, which are used less frequently.&nbsp; Until you become  quite experienced, you are only ever likely to need the first two.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>A Point of Personal  Privilege</strong> refers to  the well-being of a delegate.&nbsp; It may not refer to the resolution.&nbsp;  It may only interrupt a speaker if the speech is inaudible.&nbsp; This is the  only point that may interrupt a speaker.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>A Point of Order</strong> is a question about procedure, or if the  speaker says something offensive.&nbsp; It has to be addressed to the  Chair.&nbsp; It can be made during a pause in a speech.&nbsp; To make a point  of order, you say, “Point of Order” when the speaker pauses or finishes.&nbsp;  When the chair invites you to make your point, you should stand and ask the  chair, “Is it in order for…?”<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>A Point of Parliamentary  Enquiry</strong> is a  question to the Chair about the rules of procedure.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Orders of the Day</strong> is a call to return to the main topic of  the debate, if you think the debate has gone off topic.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Permission to Approach  the Chair</strong> is a  request to discuss a problem with the Chair privately.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Explain Vote</strong> is a request, after a vote, by a delegate  to explain the way he or she voted.&nbsp; Usually one for each FOR, AGAINST and  ABSTAINED would be given half a minute.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Move to Extend Debate  Time</strong> is a request to  have further time FOR and AGAINST a resolution.&nbsp; It should have a  seconder.&nbsp; If anyone objects, it is put to a vote (without debate), a  simple majority being required.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Move to Table</strong> is used to propose a stop to consideration  of a resolution if that resolution clearly has little support and would be a  waste of time to debate fully.&nbsp; It should have a seconder.&nbsp; If anyone  objects, it is put to a vote (without debate), a simple majority being  required.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Move the Previous  Question</strong> is a call  to end debate time and to vote on the resolution.&nbsp; It should have a  seconder.&nbsp; If anyone objects, it is put to a vote (without debate), a  two-thirds majority being required.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Move to adjourn</strong> is a proposal to finish  proceedings.&nbsp; It should have a seconder.&nbsp; If anyone objects, it is  put to a vote (without debate) a simple majority being required.<br>
    </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Refer the Question</strong> is a proposal to send a resolution to be  considered by another committee.&nbsp; It should have a seconder.&nbsp; If  anyone objects it is debated (3 minutes FOR and 3 minutes AGAINST) and is then  put to a vote, a simple majority being required.<br>

  <p align="left"><u><a name="Awards"></a>Awards</u> <br>
    At the end of the day, most conferences give awards to the best  delegates.&nbsp; The criteria for giving awards may vary from conference to conference,  but will normally include some or all of the following:</p>
  <div align="left">
    <ul type="disc">
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>how accurately you represent the views of        your country</li>
        <li>how well you construct resolutions</li>
        <li>correct use of proper debating style and        language</li>
        <li>the level of respect you show to the chairs        and other delegates</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
