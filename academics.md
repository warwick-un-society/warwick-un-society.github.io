Warwick UN Society isn’t all just debates and resolutions. We love to discuss current affairs in both a formal and informal setting.  'Diplomatea’ offers a casual platform for members to get to know each other whilst discussing topics from tackling radicalisation to ending world hunger. Formal events, like panel and roundtable discussions take place once each term, with guests including politicians and academics. We like to keep things engaging, so don’t hesitate to get into contact with us if you have an event idea you want to bring to life!

Due to the social distancing measures in place, our events will take place online until further notice. Where possible, we will hold much smaller gatherings in accordance to university guidelines. Keep your eyes peeled for the upcoming posts on our socials to stay up to date with our events!
