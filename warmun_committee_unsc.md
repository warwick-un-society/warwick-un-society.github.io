## Chairs: Phillip Graynoth, Soham Banerjee

Committee rooms: Friday S0.17, Saturday-Sunday S0.09

<b>Topics:</b>
  1. Disengagement by permanent member states in long-term military interventions

This topic offers ample opportunity for bloc building, as well as binding agreements. The USA’s and the UK’s exit from Afghanistan provides delegates topical, emotive and well-known case studies on which it is likely that their respective countries have a relevant policy, or have recently passed comment. Other examples, such as France’s presence in Mali provide further breadth as draw-downs begin. Discussion of these topics are likely to define this century’s world order and as such shape the security priorities of all member states.

  2. Addressing the increasing cybersecurity threat presented by non-state actors to national infrastructure

The globalised, de-centralised nature of modern communication and technology networks presents unique challenges to member states. National infrastructures of most countries rely heavily upon large scale networks and technological solutions that have invited both organised criminals and terrorists, as well as hostile states, to attack. Cyber-security measures cover much of the same ground as conventional military and policing policy, however, little has been codified in international agreements between countries. This provides delegates with an excellent opportunity to take on a prevalent and expanding security issue without having difficulty finding a policy niche to actually legislate within.
