*For a resolution to pass, NINE votes in favour are required with none of the P5 members (China, France, Russia, UK and USA) voting against the resolution.*

The Security Council is slightly different to the General Assembly:

* Delegates do not have to stand up to speak.

* A certain amount of dialogue is permissible.

* Resolutions are considered in more detail, debating clause by clause.

* The Security Council has more power than the General Assembly, and may demand that countries do something (rather than simply request or suggest) and may threaten economic sanctions or military action if the country does not comply.

It will hold the “experts” from delegations, so it is important to see that it runs the way you want it to be run.

Ask the delegate submitting the resolution to read the operative clauses Invite the delegate submitting the resolution to speak about the resolution.

Invite members of the Council to respond. Determine in particular if there are certain clauses that cause difficulties. Members could be invited to comment individually in alphabetical order. Members unhappy with certain clauses could be invited to submit amendments.

The resolution could be looked at as a whole paying particular attention to the clauses that members picked out as having difficulties. Usually the resolution would be examined clause by clause. This could be done by opening the floor to comment or by inviting members to comment individually in alphabetical order.

Announce that

> “the resolution will be examined clause by clause”

and

> “we will now examine clause 1”.

Either read the clause yourself or ask the submitting delegate to read it again. Ask the submitting delegate to speak briefly on the clause.

If one of the P5 opposes a clause, ask them whether they would vote against the resolution if that clause is in it.\*

At the end of the discussion take a vote on the clause. At this stage there is *NO VETO*.

Continue in this way clause by clause.

If you think there will be little opposition to a clause or time is very short ask the Council if they are willing to go directly to a vote on the clause.

\*If any P5 member threatens to vote against the resolution, remind them that the veto should only be used if it directly affects their country. Try to push them to abstaining rather than vetoing the resolution.
