Our address is:

Reigate Grammar School  
Reigate  
Surrey  
RH2 OQS  

The school is easy to find! It is situated on the south side of the A25 about a quarter of a mile east of Reigate town centre, between Reigate and Redhill. From Reigate, just follow the A25 towards Redhill for 500 metres, and the entrance is on the right at the top of the hill.

By train: The school is approximately ten minutes' walk from Reigate station, which is served by trains from London Bridge and East Croydon (Southern Railway) and from Guildford (First Great Western). There are also frequent connections to Redhill station (about one mile away) which is on the main London Victoria to Brighton line, giving fast connections to Croydon, Crawley, Horsham and other towns to the south.
