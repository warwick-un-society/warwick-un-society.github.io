Topic 1 in the Social, Cultural and Humanitarian and Human Rights commitees will involve resolution construction on the day, so delegates should bring policy statements (which will be read out) but not resolutions. Topics 2 and 3 will be the more familiar standard debate, and resolutions should be prepared in advance. The Security Council and the other three committees will follow standard debate procedure for all their topics.
