The conference will have the following programme:

* Registration

* Lobbying

* Opening Ceremony

* Committees — Resolution Construction

* Committees — Standard Debate

* General Assembly

## Lobbying

When you arrive at the conference, the first stage will be lobbying for Topics 2 and 3. In the lobbying process you will take your resolutions, show them to other delegates and try to secure their support. They may support your resolution on condition that you alter (amend) it in some way. When a delegate agrees to support a resolution, he or she will write their country name on the resolution or on the submission sheet, and becomes a co-submitter. You may find that someone else has a resolution with good points in it, so you may decide to merge your resolution with another. This is all part of the negotiation process called lobbying. Another component of lobbying might include attaining speaking rights; agree to become a co-submitter on condition that the delegates yield the floor to you.

In order for a resolution to be debated in committee it must be secure the appropriate number of co-submitters and be submitted for approval.

Resolutions for Topics 2 and 3 in all committees, and for Topic 1 on the DISEC, SPECPOL and Environment committees should be brought to the conference on the day. They should be typed, and in the format shown in this Guide. They should have a maximum of twelve operative clauses (including sub-clauses).

Resolutions to go before a committee must have at least five co-submitters from at least three different schools. There is a maximum of twelve co-submitters. Two copies should then be placed into the “For Approval” box with a resolution cover sheet. Please see separate sheet “Resolution Processing”.

Each delegate may only co-submit one resolution on each item on the committee agenda.

The Secretaries-General will select the resolution to go before the committee. Resolutions to be debated in committee will be duplicated by the secretariat.

### Approving Resolutions

When a resolution has the correct number of co-submitters it can be placed before the Approval Panel. The Approval Panel is a group of Advisors who make sure that the resolution is correctly written and formatted. An approval Panel does not judge the content of a resolution. Once a resolution has been approved it can be debated in committee.

## Opening Ceremony

There will be a short opening ceremony in the General Assembly, but no opening speeches. Following the Opening Ceremony, delegates will proceed to committees.

## Committees

Delegates may only speak in the committee to which they are assigned.

In standard debate procedure, closed debates will be ten minutes for and ten minutes against the resolution. Open debates will be 20 minutes.

Amendments raised during the debate will be allocated two minutes for and two minutes against.

The committee may pass any number of resolutions. Each resolution should be considered entirely on its own merits and in a vacuum.

Committees will operate a guillotine. This will take effect after forty minutes of debate time.

## Resolution Construction Procedure

This is the format of debate that will be used for Topic 1 in the SOCHUM and Human Rights committees, and may not be familiar to many delegates. It is relatively informal style of debate, and involves constructing resolutions on the day with fellow delegates rather than by yourself in advance. Although you will be given guidance on the day, it is essential that you research relevant topics and prepare speeches in advance if you are to get the most out of this mode of debate. The procedure is as follows.

* Opening speeches

* Formal Caucusing

* Informal Caucusing

* Lobbying

* Submission of Resolutions

* Debate

* Voting

### Opening Speeches (1 hour)

These will take place in committee. Each delegate will make a compulsory speech for no longer than one minute on the issue at hand, setting out their nation’s position and suggesting solutions to relevant problems. The order of speakers will be determined randomly. There is no right of reply at this stage. **This speech should be prepared before ReiMUN.**

### Caucusing (30 minutes)

In this stage, informal discussion takes place between delegates working together in groups of their choosing. Resolutions are constructed during this phase. The aim is to produce resolutions with as many co-submitters as possible. You should ensure that any resolution you sign reflects your country’s policy. Do not sign multiple resolutions which conflict with one another. Resolutions must be written in the formal style.

### Lobbying and Submission of Resolutions (15 mins)
There will be 15 minutes during which delegates may lobby informally to gain support for their resolutions. At the end of this period the resolutions will be submitted to the committee chairs. Three resolutions will be accepted by the chair for discussion in formal debate. Resolutions with a greater number of co-submitters are more likely to be considered for debate.

### Debate and Voting (45 minutes)

The three resolutions selected by the chairs will be read and the proposers will be asked to explain the merits of the resolutions. There will then follow standard open debate during which points may be raised on any of the three resolutions. Amendments may be submitted to resolutions at the chairs’ discretion, but the presumption is that amendments will not be used in this debate.

The resolutions will be voted on. Delegates may vote for as many of the resolutions as they wish (but should avoid voting for contradictory resolutions).

## Standard debate

Topics 2 and 3 in all committees, and Topic 1 in the DISEC, SPECPOL and Environment committees, will be debated using standard debate procedure. Resolutions which have been passed by the Approval Panel can be debated in committee. At this stage delegates are encouraged to submit amendments to improve resolutions.

### Amendments

Amendments to a resolution must be submitted to the Chair on Amendment sheets. They must state clearly:

  * The line or lines in which the amendment is to be made.

  * The clauses affected.

  * The nature of the amendment.

If an amendment passes, the floor reverts to the Chair. If it fails, it returns to the speaker on the main resolution.

### General Assembly

Only resolutions passed by committee will be debated in General Assembly.

In General Assembly there will be closed debates with ten minutes for and ten minutes against the resolution.

Amendments will not normally be entertained in General assembly. Amendments to resolutions should be made in Committee.

The General Assembly will operate a guillotine. This will take effect after thirty minutes.

### Yielding the Floor

The floor may be yielded twice consecutively to other delegates after which it returns to the Chair. A delegation will not be permitted to yield to another delegation from the same school.

### The Chair

In the interests of debate the Chair will encourage delegates to yield the floor to other delegates. Committee Chairs will advise the General Assembly President which countries have supported/opposed a resolution in committee.

## General Assembly

In the General Assembly (or GA) the various delegates rejoin as a delegation to debate resolutions that have been passed in Committee.

### Communication in the General Assembly
One delegation in the General Assembly can communicate with another by writing messages on official notepaper and having the message passed by Administration Staff. Delegates should provide their own official notepaper. This will usually be on A5 paper headed with the delegation name.
