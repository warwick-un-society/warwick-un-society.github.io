description: Issues for chairs to consider when chairing a Model United Nations Debate
---

The following section lists some of the most common issues that you will have to deal with. There are no fixed rules; the advice here is for guidance, but you should use your common sense and discretion to make a judgement on individual situations. Remember that the purpose of the day is to practise the skills of good debate in the style of the UN; however, also remember that many delegates are inexperienced and that correcting every single mistake can become tedious and unconstructive.

## <a name="resissues"></a>Resolutions

### Incorrect initiating phrases.

Preamble clauses should begin with a gerund (verbs ending with -ing or -ed). Operative clauses should begin with verbs in the third person singular present tense.

Ignore problems with the preamble, as this is not the subject of debate. If it can be done quickly, suggest a friendly amendment to operative clauses. If such amendments will be too time-consuming, ignore the issue and proceed with debate on the resolution.

### Grammar or punctuation errors.

If the error means that the resolution cannot be understood, suggest the
submitter make a friendly amendment. If the meaning is clear, ignore the issue and proceed with debate.

### Unclear or ambiguous statements.

Allow debate to proceed without raising the issue yourself. If another delegate raises the issue, suggest that the delegate submit a friendly amendment.

### Delegates saying “I” or “you”.

If the delegate appears to be experienced, quickly intervene with a gentle reminder that, “Delegates should speak in the third person.” If the delegate appears to be less experienced, allow them to finish their speech, but when they have finished make a general comment to the floor to say, “Delegates are reminded that they should refer to themselves and other delegates at all times in the third person and by the name of their country.”

### Delegates being rude or using undiplomatic language.

If the offence is, in your view, serious and/or obviously out of order, intervene immediately and ask the delegate to withdraw the comment, apologise and/or (in the most serious cases) to yield the floor. If the offence is more borderline, ignore the issue unless another delegate raises a point of order. If a point of order is raised, respond appropriately.

### Delegates going off-topic or speaking around the general issue rather than addressing the resolution directly.

If the delegate is clearly completely off topic, intervene and ask them to address the issue at hand.

If the delegate is speaking about the general issue but is not addressing the resolution, you must make a judgement about is how the best interests of good debate are served.

* If the delegate is inexperienced, or if you feel the discussion is worth having, then say nothing.

* If you feel that the point is leading the debate to become unfocused then you may, at the end of the delegate’s speech, ask if they have a particular point to make about the resolution as a whole or one of its clauses, or ask them to indicate whether they are supporting or opposing the resolution and why. You may choose to wait to see if another delegate raises this in a point of information before you raise it yourself.

* In the most serious cases, you may choose to interrupt the delegate before they have finished speaking in order to bring them back to the point, but this would be an exceptional course of action, not the norm.

A better approach would normally be to make a general point to the floor that, “Delegates are reminded to speak about the specific points raised by the resolution and not simply about the general issue.”

### The speaker goes on too long.

Gently intervene, saying, “Will the delegate please come to their closing remarks?”

## <a name="poinfoissues"></a>Points of Information

### Delegates sitting down before their point has been answered.

Ask the delegate to remain standing until their point has been answered.

### Delegates making a speech.

Intervene immediately and ask the delegate to raise a point about what the delegate who has the floor has said. Remind them that if they wish to make a speech of their own they should ask to take the floor at the appropriate time.

### Delegates not asking a question.

Ask the delegate to rephrase their point as a question. If they are unsure how to do this, suggest that they simply add the question “Do you not agree?” to what they have said.

### Delegates asking an unclear question.

Let this pass. However, if the delegate who has the floor asks for the question to be rephrased then pass this request on.
￼
### The delegate who has floor has clearly misunderstood the question that was asked.

Make your own judgement as to how the best interests of debate are served. If the issue is unimportant than let the issue pass, although grant a right of reply if
the delegate making the point of information requests it.

If the delegate asking the question appears inexperienced, you may choose to help them by saying something like, “Is that what the delegate of [Sweden] was asking? Would they like a right of reply?”

If you feel that the question that was raised was a crucial question to the progress of the debate, you may choose to rephrase the question yourself. For example, “I believe the question that the delegate of [Sweden] was raising was... Could the delegate of [Malawi] address that issue?”

### The delegate raises a second point without asking for a right of reply.

Intervene immediately with the phrase, “There shall be no dialogue on the floor.” You may choose to follow this up by asking, “Would the delegate like
to request a right of reply?”

## <a name="poorderissues"></a>Points of Order

### Delegates raising points of information as points of order.

Intervene immediately and say that that is not a point of order. Advise the delegate to raise that as a point of information at the appropriate time.

### Delegates spuriously taking offence.

Respond either by saying simply that you see nothing out of order in what was said, or suggest that the delegate raising the point of order has inferred more from the comments made than was actually said.

### If you are not sure whether the comment was out of order.

The easiest way to get out of this situation is normally to suggest that the comment made was in the delegate’s own opinion, and therefore in order, and then quickly move on.

### If an unusual point is raised that you do not understand.

This can be difficult to deal with. One approach is simply to say, “That is not in order at this time,” and move on. However, this is a risky approach if you don’t understand the point, as it may make you appear incompetent.

Alternatively, you may ask the delegate raising the point to explain why they have raised the points. This may give you a greater insight into what is being asked, without letting on that you don’t understand, and will give you time to rule whether the request is in or out of order.

If, after an explanation, you still do not understand, use a phrase such as, “In the interests of good debate, the Chair rules that this is not in order at this time.” Then move on.
