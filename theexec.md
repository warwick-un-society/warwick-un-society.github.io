    <h4>Rob Sunnucks - President</h4>
    
Hi, my name is Rob, and I am the new president of Warwick UN SocðŸ¥³

I'm about to start the 3rd year of my Maths course at uni and couldn't be more excited for what we will get up to as a society next year.

Warwick UN Soc has made my first 2 years of uni such an incredible experience, from engaging in thrilling debate in MUN, plotting and scheming in a MUN Crisis, and having such a fantastic time at the socials. I cant wait to share all of the enjoyment that I have gotten from this society with as many people as I can!

I hope we can all enjoy this next academic year, and I look forward to being your new president ðŸ™‚

    <h4>Sanchit Bagri - Vice President and Training Officer</h4>
    
Hi, everyone I am the new Vice President and Training officer, a second year Econ student, quite excited to see few US delegates finally go to DEFCON 1 and destroy this planet! Iâ€™m joking, I just had to add some MUN humour ðŸ˜….

I remember my first Warwick UN soc experience, a small training session. It ended up not being formal, going away from the topic to destroy each otherâ€™s countries. Well that is what MUNing is about after all, forget the agenda and destroy each other ðŸ˜…. Iâ€™m quite excited to more of such heated debates but also genuine discussions to realise the world around us needs to be worked on by cooperation.

Canâ€™t wait to see you guys at UNsoc!

    <h4>Haroon Khan - Treasurer and Conference Manager</h4>
    
Hi everyone, My name is Haroon, and I am your new Treasurer and Conference Manager.

A second-year Accounting and Finance student who has a passion for debate. I am excited to scout people and give them the chance to go to competitive MUN Tournaments hopefully (in person) but also hoping that debate gets heated in the training sessions!

My favourite UN Society memory would probably be the small training session we had at the start of the year where I was the USA and where we were just dissing each other assigned countries. Or the time at LIMUN where I was Bangladesh in the Historical Security Council, unfortunately, the P5's were cooperating with each other ðŸ˜”.

UN Society has great potential and cannot wait to see what this new year brings!!!

    <h4>Waleed Qureshi - Academic Officer</h4>
      

hi, my name is Waleed Qureshi and iâ€™m the new academic officer.

i study law and like to keep up with the news so i thought why not apply for academic officer. Iâ€™ve never attended an MUN before but letâ€™s just say iâ€™m always up for a good debate.

hopefully we are going to run some events where we can discuss global matters with some notable speakers and learn something from them, but more on that soon.

i hope you are excited for what we have to offer for this year!

    <h4>Kat Mangam - Publicity Officer</h4>
    Hi, my name is Kat, Iâ€™m the publicity officer and Iâ€™m a 3rd year EPAIS student. I joined Warwick UN Society as a fresher with no prior experience but with the help of weekly training sessions and general support from other members I was able to learn so much and feel confident in my debate. The society balances both academic and social events and I hope I can convince you to come to both through my marketing! Iâ€™m so excited to be a part of the exec and take the supportive spirit forward. I hope to be an approachable and accessible figure if you ever need any help or guidance ðŸ™‚
