    <h4>Aaron Gilchrist - President</h4>
    Aaron Gilchrist is a second year Mathematics student at the University of Warwick who is the Founder and Secretary General of WARMUN High School.
    <br><br>
    He is the Training Officer of Warwick UN Society for 2019-2020: in this role he is tasked with teaching new delegates how to do MUN and furthering the development of existing members of the society. He co-founded the Warwick UN Society MUN 101 Workshop, an innovative programme designed to transform new MUNers into esteemed diplomats in the timescale of one  day: he hopes to extend this to a new audience through the longer timescale of the WARMUN High School conference.<br><br>
    He has attended over 30 conferences in his seven-year MUN career in a variety of roles; highlights include being Secretary General of his schoolâ€™s conference, ReiMUN, and being the President of the Special Conferences and 200 delegate plenary at MUNISH 2017. He really enjoys meeting new people from around the world, and MUN conferences provide the perfect environment for this.<br><br>
    While he is not doing MUN, he is always studying, but in the rare instances he is not doing either of these things, Aaron enjoys cooking, eating, and socialising.
    <br><br>
    Fun fact: Aaron has never eaten ice cream.
